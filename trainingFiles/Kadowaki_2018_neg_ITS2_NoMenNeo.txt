plants influence their soil environment which affects the next generation of seedlings that

can be established while research has shown that such plant–soil feedbacks occur in the

presence of mycorrhizal fungi it remains unclear when and how mycorrhizal fungi mediate

the direction and strength of feedbacks in tree communities here we show that arbuscular

mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungal guilds mediate plant–soil feedbacks differently to

influence large scale patterns such as tree species coexistence and succession when

seedlings are grown under the same mycorrhizal type forest arbuscular mycorrhizal plant

species exhibit negative or neutral feedbacks and ectomycorrhizal plant species do neutral or

positive feedbacks in contrast positive and neutral feedbacks dominate when seedlings are

grown in associations within the same versus different mycorrhizal types thus ectomy 

corrhizal communities show more positive feedbacks than arbuscular mycorrhizal commu 

nities potentially explaining why most temperate forests are ectomycorrhizal

feedbacks between plant community assembly and soil biotaare critical to understanding the dynamics of forest eco systems such as coexistence and succession – plant–soil
feedbacks influence seedling community assembly when the
effects of soil biota that reside in association with a given plant
species are expressed more strongly on conspecific than on het 
erospecific seedlings – recent studies have emphasized that the
direction and strength of plant–soil feedbacks can be explained by
the mycorrhizal fungal types or guilds of plant species 
negative feedbacks are generally limited to arbuscular mycor 
rhizal plant species and positive feedbacks are typically observed
in ectomycorrhizal plant species the negative feedbacks of
arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species increase the abundance of
soil biota that make the soil less suitable for conspecific seedlings
relative to heterospecifics thereby promoting the coexistence of
different arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species at the community
level – in contrast the positive feedbacks of ectomycorrhizal
plant species increase the abundance of soil biota that favor
conspecific seedlings over heterospecifics thereby promoting the
dominance of the ectomycorrhizal plant species within a
community 

while many studies have assessed the direction and strength of
plant–soil feedbacks within the same mycorrhizal type i e 
growth responses of arbuscular mycorrhizal seedlings under
arbuscular mycorrhizal resident trees or those of ectomycorrhizal
seedlings under ectomycorrhizal resident trees few studies have
quantified feedbacks when resident plants and colonizing seed 
lings have mismatched mycorrhizal types bennett et al mea 
sured feedbacks using the growth responses of seedlings in soils
conditioned by conspecifics and heterospecifics they concluded
that the direction and strength of feedbacks were generally spe 
cies specific and hence plant species identity i e whether the
resident species is conspecific or heterospecific could be a more
important predictor of plant–soil feedbacks than mycorrhizal
type match mismatch nevertheless given that arbuscular
mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants co occur across broad
climatic ranges and that ectomycorrhizal forests frequently have
an arbuscular mycorrhizal understory in temperate zones 
matching mismatching of mycorrhizal type between resident
plants and recruited seedlings may play a prominent role in
driving plant community dynamics for example ectomy 
corrhizal seedlings may grow faster than arbuscular mycorrhizal
seedlings when colonizing forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal
trees generating positive feedbacks as a consequence of mycor 
rhizal type matching alternatively negative feedbacks may allow
for species with contrasting mycorrhizal types to coexist in mixed
communities as a result of the suppression of dominant spe 
cies given that trees may attempt to recruit into areas that are
more homogeneously dominated by either arbuscular mycor 
rhizal or ectomycorrhizal plants not mixed compositions as in
bennett et al mycorrhizal type matching could govern the
outcome of plant–soil feedbacks with possible consequences for
seedling community assembly 

to better understand how plant–soil feedbacks affect seedling
community assembly in natural communities emphasis should
shift from the feedback effects responses of one plant species on
another e g home versus away experiments to the feedbacks in
multi species community contexts in such contexts plant–soil
feedbacks may emerge as a general community scale process 
where multiple seedlings and residents collectively form common
mycelial networks belowground via mycorrhizal fungi – these
networks have the potential to modulate how resident species
modify the soil biotic properties and how seedling species
respond to these changes through a broad set of mechanisms
 e g transfers of nutrients among connected resident and seed 
ling species and modifying biogeochemical cycling 

while there is some evidence that plant–soil feedbacks have a
greater impact in mixed species communities few studies have
investigated feedbacks in the presence of microbiota potentially
connecting neighboring resident trees and seedlings via mycelial
networks such community scale feedbacks may influence seed 
ling community assembly differently from the commonly studied
species pairwise feedbacks possibly through different below 
ground mechanisms 

here we examine whether community scale plant–soil feed 
backs affect seedling community assembly and if so how these
effects may be linked with mycorrhizal type match mismatch 
using experimental mesocosms simulating mixed species forest
stands we established resident sapling communities carrying
mycorrhizal inocula the conditioning phase and then intro 
duced uninoculated seedling communities into the mesocosms
and followed the subsequent growth of the seedlings the feed 
back phase by implementing this experiment in a fully factorial
design—that is by varying mycorrhizal type of resident forest
types arbuscular mycorrhizal ectomycorrhizal and control
 mimic trees and seedling community types arbuscular
mycorrhizal ectomycorrhizal and control no seedlings —we
are able to make a direct inference regarding how mycorrhizal
type match mismatch mediates plant–soil feedbacks in the pre 
sence of soil microbiota at the community level specifically by
adopting a spatially hierarchical design where sapling species
treatments are nested within a mesocosm we address two layered
predictions about how seedling species respond to the soil con 
ditions modified by conspecific heterospecific saplings and or by
matching mismatching mycorrhizal types we used seedlings as
phytometers to measure the properties of neighboring saplings
 i e conspecific versus heterospecific sapling microenviron 
ments and mesocosm i e mycorrhizal type 

our findings indicate that seedlings generally exhibited nega 
tive to positive feedbacks depending on sapling seedling species
combinations when comparing plant–soil feedbacks associated
with conspecific versus heterospecific saplings within mesocosms
with same mycorrhizal type i e arbuscular mycorrhizal seedlings
grown in arbuscular mycorrhizal resident forests or ectomycor 
rhizal seedlings grown with ectomycorrhizal resident forests we
tended to detect negative or neutral feedbacks for arbuscular
mycorrhizal plant species and neutral or positive feedbacks for
ectomycorrhizal plant species in contrast when comparing
plant–soil feedbacks associated with heterospecific saplings in
matching versus mismatching mesocosms i e arbuscular
mycorrhizal seedlings grown in ectomycorrhizal resident forests 
and ectomycorrhizal seedlings grown in arbuscular mycorrhizal
resident forests we found positive to neutral feedbacks at the
mesocosm scale we conclude that the assembly of a temperate
tree community may be determined by a combination of species 
specific plant–soil feedbacks within the same mycorrhizal fungal
guild and positive plant–soil feedbacks driven by the match 
mismatch of mycorrhizal type between resident plants and
seedlings by accounting for community scale plant–soil feed 
backs we will be able to consider how tree species of the same
mycorrhizal type can coexist and why ectomycorrhizal trees but
not arbuscular mycorrhizal trees can become dominant in late 
successional temperate forest communities

in a randomized block design we assessed seedling growth
responses under different resident conditions over two growing
seasons figs and to initiate the conditioning phase a
resident forest community was set up in each mesocosm with
four resident species four saplings each arrayed in × latin
square grids in order to avoid spatial clumping of sapling species

mentary table then at the feedback phase each seedling
species was planted underneath the sapling in each grid cell and a
total of seedlings all four seedling species combined were
placed into the resident forest figs and see also methods 
based on this experimental design we were able to address how
seedling species responded to the soil conditions modified by
conspecific heterospecific saplings within a mesocosm and or

this we built a linear mixed effects model using ln transformed

conditions we also analyzed growth responses using leaf weight
and root weight separately and confirmed that the results were
qualitatively similar as found for total seedling biomass sup 
plementary figure thus seedling performance near hetero 
specific saplings in matching versus mismatching fungal
mesocosms indicated positive to neutral feedbacks at the
mesocosm scale fig 

sharing of mycorrhizal fungi feedbacks could become more
positive when previously conditioned soil fungal biota of the
matching resident forest community improved seedling growth
relative to that conditioned by the mismatching forest commu 
nity to explore the possibility of the root associated fungal
community as a driver of the observed plant–soil feedbacks we
examined whether seedlings are more strongly associated with
fungi associated with matching sapling communities i e arbus 
cular mycorrhizal resident arbuscular mycorrhizal seedling and
ectomycorrhizal resident ectomycorrhizal seedling conditions 
than with mismatching sapling communities a high throughput
dna sequencing analysis supported this hypothesis showing
greater compositional similarity in the root associated fungal
communities of saplings and introduced seedlings under the
matching condition f p for an overview of
the results of the sequencing analysis see supplementary note 
and supplementary figures – notably the effects of mycor 
rhizal type matching differed between arbuscular mycorrhizal and
ectomycorrhizal symbioses fig for the arbuscular

mycorrhizal seedling community matching and mismatching
treatments showed a similar level of fungal compositional simi

 indicating no preferential association with either resident
forest type for the ectomycorrhizal seedling community how 
ever matching the mycorrhizal type increased the similarity

were more strongly associated with fungi associated with
matching resident saplings than with those associated with mis 
matching saplings however there was no such pattern for
arbuscular mycorrhizal seedlings

that common mycorrhizal networks connecting seedlings and
saplings might function as a community scale driver of plant–soil

 fig allowed us to evaluate such spatial patterns arbuscular
mycorrhizal seedling communities showed weaker spatial struc 
turing fig which did not depend on match mismatch with
the resident forest types welch’s two sample t test t – 
df p in contrast ectomycorrhizal seedling
communities displayed significantly different degrees of spatial
structuring between matching and mismatching conditions t 
 df p altogether the ectomycorrhizal
plant community developed spatially structured networks with
the fungi associated with matching resident saplings whereas the
arbuscular mycorrhizal plant community did not exhibit such a
pattern thus the effect of soil conditioning on common
mycorrhizal networks was greater for ectomycorrhizal species
than for arbuscular mycorrhizal species the results suggest that
greater differentiation of the fungal communities between
matching versus mismatching conditions might correspond with
plant–soil feedbacks such that ectomycorrhizal trees exert greater
changes to the soil fungal community environment which may
correspond with their greater tendency for positive feedbacks 

discussion
based on a mesocosm experiment of arbuscular mycorrhizal and
ectomycorrhizal artificial plant communities we examined how
mycorrhizal types determine plant–soil microbiota feedbacks 
previous studies have generally reported negative feedbacks in
arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species and positive feedbacks in
ectomycorrhizal species and bennett et al emphasized that

species specific feedbacks could play a more important role than
mycorrhizal type match mismatch we found that in a multi 
species community context the direction and strength of feed 
backs depend critically on mycorrhizal type match mismatch 
when seedlings colonize forests dominated by the matching
mycorrhizal type arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species tend to
exhibit negative or neutral feedbacks and ectomycorrhizal plant
species do neutral or positive feedbacks fig in contrast when
seedlings colonize forests dominated by the matching versus
mismatching mycorrhizal type both arbuscular mycorrhizal and
ectomycorrhizal species exhibit neutral or positive feedbacks as a
consequence of mycorrhizal type matching fig our results
suggest when these within and across mycorrhizal type feed 
backs occur simultaneously in natural forest ectomycorrhizal
plant species may show more positive feedbacks than arbuscular
mycorrhizal plant species do consequently the assembly of a
temperate tree seedling community may be shaped by a combi 
nation of variable feedbacks within the same mycorrhizal guilds
and positive feedbacks across different mycorrhizal guilds 

this study also revealed that the root associated fungal com 
munity shared between saplings and seedlings may be associated
with the observed patterns of plant–soil feedbacks specifically 
for the ectomycorrhizal plant community seedlings’ fungal
symbiont acquisition and the spatial structuring of belowground
fungal communities may account for the pattern that ectomy 
corrhizal seedlings generally performed better under the match 
ing resident forests than under the mismatching forests figs

and we propose that the observed effects of mycorrhizal type
matching on resident–seedling feedbacks may have resulted from
four non mutually exclusive mechanisms first more spatially
extended and temporally prolonged infection of seedling roots by
matching fungal communities than by mismatching ones second 
detrimental effects of incompatible mycorrhizal fungi for seed 
lings when grown with mismatched saplings third access to a
larger soil nutrient pool made available by compatible fungal
networks than by incompatible networks – and fourth more
active transport of nutrients from resource rich regions of
mycelial networks to resource poor areas via more structured
hyphal networks provided by matching symbioses the analyses
of fungal communities within the mesocosms figs and are
consistent with all these possibilities nevertheless the use of the
internal transcribed spacer its region in the molecular analysis
might have resulted in a low detection rate of arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi see ref for more and it is likely that

arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities would have displayed
spatial structuring when analyzed using dna markers specific to
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi while our results suggest the roles
of mycorrhizal fungal communities and their belowground net 
works as a potential driver of plant–soil feedbacks detailed
mechanisms underlying the link between fungal symbiont
acquisition and plant−soil feedbacks require further
investigation 

our approach to determining plant–soil feedbacks is different
from previous research in two important ways first previous
studies either focused on the effects of live soil inocula associated
with a single resident plant species on conspecific or hetero 
specific seedlings i e plant competition free conditions or
on the effects of one resident plant species on another in the
presence of resident seedling competition – our study
assembled plant−soil communities on identical substrates of a set
area naturally and in situ at a field site and for a known period of

time and then measured seedling growth responses under con 
ditions in which both plant competition and mycorrhizal net 
works were allowed to develop these features made it possible to
examine feedbacks in more realistic multi species plant com 
munities second most field studies have used fungicide to test
for the potential effects of soil pathogens but such chemical
applications were necessarily confounded with possible reduc 
tions of soil mycorrhizal fungi which could also act as key agents
of feedbacks by combining a factorial experiment with
follow up sequencing we were able to quantify the similarities in
root associated fungal community composition between resident
trees and seedlings as a potential key agent of plant−soil feed 
backs our findings show that the biological effect of plant−soil
interactions can be placed into a broader community context 
whereas it has typically been only observed in pairwise
interactions 

it is necessary to note however some caveats of our study 
first there are some methodological limitations in our soil
handling which might potentially bias the estimation of feed 
backs see methods for mode detail second at the conditioning
phase of the experiment we chose to use mycorrhizal saplings
 collected from natural forests by a local nursery over using
cultured mycorrhizal inocula therefore it is possible that diverse
soil biota other than mycorrhizal fungi might have driven the
observed feedbacks for instance bacteria soil micro arthropods 
and nematodes are also known as potential key agents of plant
−soil feedbacks so whether they could explain the direc 
tion and strength of feedbacks observed in our study is still an
open question third we did not account for variation in plant
species composition and richness in the mesocosm designs for
the sake of experimental feasibility and tractability we assembled
two artificial tree communities from each type to test for
matching mismatching feedbacks if we are to confirm the gen 
erality of the findings further studies must be undertaken to
assess how the direction and strength of feedbacks differ
depending on the compositions of the arbuscular mycorrhizal
and ectomycorrhizal plant species used to build the experimental

mesocosms this is important because research has shown that
plant–soil feedbacks can not only affect plant community struc 
ture but see ref but also be affected by plant community
structure fourth seedlings used in this study might have
exceeded the stage susceptible to soil pathogens which might have
caused underestimation of negative soil biota effects and this
possibility cannot be ruled out given the scarcity of pathogens
detected in our study supplementary figure a related issue is
that such pathogens are known to deactivate under high light
intensity potentially reducing the efficacy of pathogen mediated
negative feedbacks despite our efforts to simulate the natural
forest environment by controlling for light availability experi 
enced by seedlings see experimental design described in meth 
ods our field experiment might have been performed in
environments with higher light intensity compared to previous
studies previous experiments and ours may thus differ in several
aspects potentially influencing the functioning of plant–soil
microbiota feedbacks e g light intensity soil fertility – 
and hence the results of feedbacks should be interpreted with
caution see supplementary table for the soil chemical profiles
for our experiment 

understanding plant–soil feedbacks in mixed species com 
munities and evaluating how contrasting plant mycorrhizal types
shape plant−soil feedbacks are critical to predicting plant com 
munity dynamics and succession our findings show that the
effects of plant–soil feedbacks on seedling community assembly
can be modulated by mycorrhizal type match mismatch and
such matching effects may emerge as a community scale process
in which the networks of interactions formed by soil microbiota
influence the outcome of seedling community assembly 
plant–soil feedback theory predicts that stronger negative feed 
backs are more likely to stabilize species coexistence within the
same mycorrhizal fungal guilds i e within an arbuscular
mycorrhizal plant community or an ectomycorrhizal plant
community whereas more positive feedbacks observed across
different mycorrhizal types are more likely to allow specific
mycorrhizal plant guilds to become dominant in a forest in our

corrhizal plant dominated forest our findings may provide clues
to simultaneously explain why different tree species of the same
mycorrhizal type can coexist in a natural temperate forest and
why ectomycorrhizal plant communities but not arbuscular
mycorrhizal plant communities often dominate in late 
successional temperate forest 

although the idea that mycorrhizal type is a significant pre 
dictor of plant community succession is not new it has not
been tested experimentally at the community level this study is a
first step toward contrasting arbuscular mycorrhizal and ecto 
mycorrhizal plant–soil feedbacks in a multi species context and
highlights the importance of simultaneously examining arbus 
cular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plant communities as
mycorrhizal types have been linked to plant nutritional acquisi 
tion strategies soil properties and nutrient cycling they
provide a useful approach for an understanding of feedbacks at
the ecosystem level to develop a more comprehensive under 
standing of plant community assembly future studies need to
quantitatively evaluate the roles of both arbuscular mycorrhizal
and ectomycorrhizal fungi as well as the diversity and
biomass of mycorrhizal endophytic and pathogenic fungi in
plant root systems in association with various abiotic fac 
tors incorporating such complexities of real belowground
plant–soil interactions will be an avenue for better predicting
plant community dynamics 

methods
model system using plant species common to warm temperate forests in japan 
we studied two types of model communities a four species arbuscular mycorrhizal
plant community composed of a palmatum thunb c japonica l cinnamomum
camphora l j presl and p jamasakura siebold ex koidz h ohba and a four 
species ectomycorrhizal plant community composed of castanopsis cuspidata
 thunb schottky carpinus laxiflora sieb et zucc blume p densiflora sieb 
zucc and q serrata murray fig for information of ecological traits of

individual species see supplementary table the arbuscular mycorrhizal and
ectomycorrhizal plant species used in this study occur sympatrically or para 
patrically in secondary forests around kyoto city in which the experimental
mesocosms of the model communities were constructed see below 

for the conditioning phase described below experimental design saplings of
the eight species ≤ cm stem height whose roots had been infected by naturally
occurring mycorrhizal fungi were acquired from native stands by a local nursery
 nakanishi shiseien co ltd kyoto japan because conspecific saplings
 prospective resident trees arrived at our field station with potentially different soil
fungal communities we performed conspecific homogenization before
transplanting them to the mesocosms to do this saplings of each species were
incubated independently for months using pots cm × cm × cm filled
with non mycorrhizal red ball soil akadama in a glasshouse prior to use in the
experiment red ball soil the base soil component used in the conspecific
homogenization step and seedling preparation below was surface mined 
pasteurized and bagged by a supplier during the pot treatment each sapling’s root
system was covered by nylon mesh allowing mycelia but not fine roots to spread
across to neighboring conspecific saplings within the pots tree saplings were then
transplanted with nylon mesh removed to the mesocosms 

while our attempt at the conspecific homogenization step was to homogenize
the microbiota of subsets of field conditioned saplings i e all conspecific resident
trees it should be noted that following recent reviews of best practices for plant
−soil feedback studies we recognize a potential limitation in our experimental
design plant−soil feedback studies should avoid homogenizing soil samples biota
across experimental units e g sapling species because such methods are likely to
generate potentially biased inferences due to this reason future mesocosm
studies should either homogenize the microbiota of all resident tree species prior to
the mesocosm conditioning phase or avoid homogenization steps entirely and
allow for two conditioning phases i e field and mesocosm thus it is
important to note that the soil handling methods should be selected based on
research questions and goals 

for the feedback phase described below experimental design seeds were
purchased from the nursery and individually sown seeds were bought from
nakanishi shiseien co ltd and kept with moistened sphagnum moss in the
refrigerator until sowing seeds were individually sown in m pots filled with non 
mycorrhizal red ball soil the pots were maintained in a chamber covered with
black plastic film shading at °c for months in order to ensure that all
species were of comparable size – cm stem height at the introduction of the
seedlings into mesocosms while the red ball soil was pasteurized by a supplier
before use we could not entirely exclude the possibility that the propagated
seedlings started off with mycorrhizal fungal contamination in this background
soil we planted those uninoculated seedlings directly into mesocosms instead of

sowing seeds in order to focus on sapling effects on the seedlings that survived not
on mortality before the development of mycorrhizal symbiosis three month old
seedlings should be less susceptible than germinants to various environmental
stresses e g heat frost and desiccation and were therefore suitable for our
purpose 

experimental design the common garden experiment was performed in an open
field established at kyoto university botanical garden kyoto city japan ° ′
 ″n ° ′ ″e we designed a full factorial mesocosm experiment involving
arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plant systems to assess and compare
the effects of mycorrhizal type matching on the outcome of plant–soil feedbacks a
total of mesocosms were set up in four spatial blocks each m × m with each
block containing nine mesocosms the treatment design included resident forest
types arbuscular mycorrhizal ectomycorrhizal and control mimic trees ×
 seedling community types arbuscular mycorrhizal ectomycorrhizal and control
 no seedlings × replicates in a randomized block design fig 

in february we established the mesocosms each measuring m ×
 m × m and filled them with a standardized mixture of non sterilized red ball
soil of the volume decomposed granite soil and litter soil 
 fig a for arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal forest type treatments 
mycorrhizal saplings were initially planted to establish whole fungal communities
as conditioning live inoculum in the mesocosms model system each mesocosm
was composed of saplings arrayed in a × latin square fig with the
constraint that all treatment plant species must be equally represented in every row
and column within a mesocosm therefore we laid a grid system to avoid spatial
clumping of certain plant species within a mesocosm during the course of the
study five castanopsis saplings already established in the mesocosms were
discovered to be a different ectomycorrhizal species quercus glauca because those
two species’ morphologies are very similar when small so the data for the grid
cells to which this incorrect albeit effectively ectomycorrhizal species were applied
were removed from downstream statistical analysis 

at the feedback phase i e starting months after establishing resident forests 
fig b arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal seedling treatments were
applied to the mesocosms following a fully crossed factorial design with
introduction of the uninfected arbuscular mycorrhizal seedling community
 seedling species × individuals and introduction of the uninfected
ectomycorrhizal seedling community seedling species × individuals for
seedling addition treatments seedlings one individual for each of four seedling
species were planted directly into each of the grid cells i e under the
 saplings within a mesocosm in each grid cell four seedlings were planted in the
four inter cardinal positions cm from each of the centered saplings with seedling
species’ positions assigned randomly in each grid cell fig by implementing this
configuration we were able to quadruplicate all possible species pairwise
sapling–seedling interactions within grid cells thereby averaging sapling–seedling
interactions at the whole mesocosm scale in the first week of the experiment 
seedlings that died were replaced 

as controls we set up three types of control mesocosms first no saplings were
present and instead mimic trees were planted i e resident control second no
seedlings were added i e seedling control and third neither saplings nor
seedlings were present i e true control specifically the resident control
treatment comprised handmade mimic trees made of a pole wire and
cheesecloth with the aim of eliminating differences across treatments in the light
conditions experienced by seedlings during the feedback phase fig with this
control treatment we were able to focus on sapling effects via alteration of nutrient
competition and plant–soil feedbacks rather than those via changes in light
availability 

after the seedling addition we watered mesocosms every day for the first
 weeks and then once every days in summer and once every week in other
seasons depending on the weather until month before harvesting in we
allowed for litter and spore deposition within individual mesocosms during the
study weeds were removed on a weekly basis as soon as discovered individual
mesocosms were covered by black shade nets that reduced sunlight by during
summer and by frost prevention nets m high tacked by clothes pins 
shading urin factory inc kyoto japan during winter the shading was
undertaken to better simulate natural forest environment in an open field site 
throughout the experimental period our common garden was unaffected by any
detectable disturbance e g typhoons 

we made two modifications to the experimental design because of low
germination rates of two arbuscular mycorrhizal species c camphora and p 
jamasakura first c camphora was replaced by a surrogate arbuscular
mycorrhizal species celtis sinensis pers for seedling treatment hence this species
occurred only as a seedling species not as a resident forest species second we
transplanted p jamasakura seedlings only to the second and third columns in each
mesocosm fig 

harvest over the two growing seasons survival height stem width number of
leaves and light intensity were followed for each seedling on a quarterly basis until
the final census in september at harvest all saplings and seedlings were
excavated with utmost care to separate the roots of individual plants with their
aboveground biomass still attached to aid identification especially when saplings

and seedling roots intermingled each sample was thoroughly washed in a separate
bucket filled with running tap water for molecular analysis we collected cm
pieces of about eight terminal roots from each washed sample from all of the
surviving seedlings and saplings and stored them in ethanol at – °c all the
raw sapling and seedling samples were placed individually in plastic bags and
stored in the refrigerator until further processing for scanning weighing dry plant
samples e g leaf stem root and physiochemistry analysis as a whole we col 
lected data for relative growth rate of seedling height dry leaf stem and root
weights at harvest total leaf area seedling stem diameter at base and leaf
chlorophyll we analyzed the results for total seedling biomass dry leaf stem and
root weights combined and the results using leaf weight and root weight mea 
surements separately are presented in supplementary figure all the measure 
ments obtained during the study are included in supplementary data 

fungal community structure for each sapling and seedling sample the com 
position of root associated fungi was examined using pyrosequencing for numbers
of samples used for the analysis see supplementary table each sample
represented five randomly selected terminal roots ca cm each and was pro 
cessed using the protocol detailed in the supplementary information supple 
mentary note next generation sequencing analysis of root associated fungal
communities total dna was extracted from each sample using the cetyl 
trimethylammonium bromide method we amplified the entire its region and the
partial ribosomal large subunit region using the fungus specific high coverage
primer its f kyo and the universal primer lr pcr was conducted with a
temperature profile of °c for min followed by cycles at °c for s °
c for s and °c for s and a final extension at °c for min using the
buffer and polymerase system of ampdirect plus shimadzu kyoto japan we
subjected the pcr product from each root sample to a second pcr step that
targeted the its region the second pcr was conducted using the universal
primer its kyo fused with adaptor a and sample specific molecular id 
the reverse universal primer was lr kyo b fused with adaptor b a buffer
system of taq dna polymerase together with standard taq buffer new england
biolabs ipswich ma usa was used with a temperature profile of °c for 
min followed by cycles at °c for s °c for s and °c for s and a
final extension at °c for min sequencing was performed using a gs junior
 roche diagnostics indianapolis in usa 

we then performed bioinformatics analysis using claident v as
detailed in the supplementary information briefly fungal operational taxonomic
units otus were defined at a cutoff sequence similarity of and potentially
chimeric otus were removed using uchime v the taxonomic
assignment was performed with the query centric auto k nearest neighbor
method using the nt database downloaded from the ncbi ftp server http www 
ncbi nlm nih gov ftp the sequencing result table used for statistical analysis is
included in supplementary data 

seedling growth response we defined gx y as the averaged total biomass of
seedling species x under resident sapling species y in a mesocosm and used this as
a mesocosm level indicator of seedling growth response for downstream analyses
 for illustration of the calculation see supplementary figure for example in an
ectomycorrhizal seedling × ectomycorrhizal resident mesocosm gpinus carpinus 
was calculated by averaging the growth responses of pinus seedlings measured in
quadruplicate per mesocosm around the four carpinus saplings fig and
gpinus castanopsis gpinus pinus and gpinus quercus were computed as well in
the same mesocosm this calculation was repeated for all possible pairs of seedling
species x and sapling species y in each mesocosm for each of the four spatial blocks
 see experimental design 

to assess the two layered predictions addressed above for individual seedling
species we used the approach of subsetting data by seedling species and fitting a
linear mixed effects model ‘lmer’ function on these single seedling species
datasets in each analysis we used ln transformed growth response of seedling
species x that is ln gx y as the response variable sapling species identity y as a
fixed effects predictor and block as a random effects predictor by using
conspecific sapling species as the baseline the estimated coefficient for the sapling
species term takes the form of ln growth with heterospecific sapling gx y growth
with conspecific sapling gx x and its deviation from zero i e signature of
positive or negative feedbacks can be tested using standard statistical models 
specifically we performed analysis using the ‘lmer’ model formula ln gx y 
sapling species block 

we used two forms of a priori linear contrasts to statistically assess the two
predictions for each species that seedlings grown with conspecific saplings perform
better or worse than seedlings grown with heterospecific saplings and that seedlings
show a greater growth response in the presence of matching relative to
mismatching mycorrhizal type we used a custom a priori contrast ghlt
function to address these questions note that in this model the tests from
different seedling species of the same mycorrhizal type i e under matching
scenarios might not be independent from each other due to spatial associations
within mesocosms as such the test of growth responses under saplings of the
matching mycorrhizal types may provide a weaker test than that under saplings of
the mismatching mycorrhizal type

sharing of mycorrhizal fungi using molecular analysis of root associated fungal
communities see supplementary figures and supplementary note for the
overview of the sequencing results we examined whether seedlings exhibited
greater compositional similarity of root associated fungi with resident saplings in
matching treatments i e arbuscular mycorrhizal resident arbuscular mycorrhizal
seedling and ectomycorrhizal resident ectomycorrhizal seedling than in mis 
matching treatments in so doing we calculated the morisita–horn similarity
coefficient – cmh in fungal otu composition for paired sapling and seedling
species i e co occurring within the same grids and averaged the similarity
coefficient across all possible sapling–seedling species pairs to obtain a mesocosm 
level indicator of seedlings’ fungal symbiont acquisition n for results of
sapling–seedling species pairwise similarity see supplementary figure because
of the slightly different spatial design between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ecto 
mycorrhizal seedling addition treatments see experimental design we examined
differences in the mesocosm level fungal compositional similarity between
matching and mismatching treatments each n for arbuscular mycorrhizal
and ectomycorrhizal seedling type separately using welch’s t test instead of a
linear model and two way anova 

spatial structuring of plant–fungus associations to evaluate the tendency of
seedlings to share fungal species otus with closer saplings than with distant
ones we calculated compositional dissimilarity using cmh for every possible
individual sapling–seedling pair in each mesocosm we generated two i × j distance
matrices a each entry representing the dissimilarity coefficient between sapling
and seedling in a mesocosm and b each entry representing physical euclidean
distance between the paired sapling and seedling

by stacking each of the two matrices into a single column i e a a a

plant–fungus spatial structuring n a higher r indicates that closely located
sapling–seedling pairs shared a higher proportion of the fungal communities than
did distantly located pairs we examined differences in spearman’s correlation
