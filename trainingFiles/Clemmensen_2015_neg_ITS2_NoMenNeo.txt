summary

� boreal forest soils store a major proportion of the global terrestrial carbon c and below 
ground inputs contribute as much as above ground plant litter to the total c stored in the soil 

a better understanding of the dynamics and drivers of root associated fungal communities is

essential to predict long term soil c storage and climate feedbacks in northern ecosystems 
� we used pyrosequencing to identify fungal communities across fine scaled soil profiles
in a yr fire driven boreal forest chronosequence with the aim of pinpointing shifts in

fungal community composition that may underlie variation in below ground c sequestration 
� in early successional stage forests higher abundance of cord forming ectomycorrhizal
fungi such as cortinarius and suillus species was linked to rapid turnover of mycelial bio 

mass and necromass efficient nitrogen n mobilization and low c sequestration in late suc 

cessional stage forests cord formers declined while ericoid mycorrhizal ascomycetes

continued to dominate potentially facilitating long term humus build up through production

of melanized hyphae that resist decomposition 
� our results suggest that cord forming ectomycorrhizal fungi and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi
play opposing roles in below ground c storage we postulate that by affecting turnover and

decomposition of fungal tissues mycorrhizal fungal identity and growth form are critical

determinants of c and n sequestration in boreal forests 

introduction

humus layers of northern ecosystems have accumulated carbon
 c since the last glaciation and boreal and arctic soils presently
account for almost half of the global c stored in soil and litter
 pan et al low temperatures and low litter quality both
of which impair plant litter decomposition rates have been
invoked as principal drivers of organic matter accumulation in
northern ecosystems brovkin et al makkonen et al 
 however the dominant plant species in boreal forests
allocate a substantial proportion of their c below ground to
mycorrhizal fungal symbionts and the dominant type of mycor 
rhizal association has been identified as an important global pre 
dictor of soil c storage averill et al fungal tissues
potentially represent a large c input into soil organic matter
pools langley hungate cairney wallander
et al using a bomb c model we recently showed that
at least half of the accumulated c in humus layers of boreal for 
ested islands originated from root derived inputs rather than
from above ground plant litter inputs clemmensen et al 
analyses of biochemical markers and stable isotopes indicated
that this accumulated c largely originated from fungal mycelium 

these islands collectively represent a large post fire successional
gradient ranging from to yr since the last fire and we
concluded that impaired decomposition of organic matter
derived from mycorrhizal fungi was a main driver of c accumula 
tion in the rooting zone with increasing duration of absence of
fire shifts in c dynamics within the root associated fungal com 
munity thus have the potential to play a central regulatory role
in the long term accumulation of soil c 

differences in both fungal biomass production and turnover
and necromass degradation are likely to be important determi 
nants of long term c accumulation and may vary considerably
among both fungal species and different tissues fernandez 
koide ekblad et al wallander et al agerer
 categorized ectomycorrhizal fungal species into short and
long distance exploration types based on the amount and differ 
entiation of their extramatrical mycelium mycelium of short dis 
tance types is composed of simple hyphae that explore soil closer
to the roots whereas the mycelium of long distance types differ 
entiates into hydrophobic hyphal cords that connect mycorrhizal
root tips with a more distant exploratory mycelium this growth
form framework can potentially link mycorrhizal fungal commu 
nity composition to c cycling processes koide et al

cord forming types have been proposed to be the most
c demanding as a result of their extensive growth hobbie 
and could potentially contribute large amounts of mycelial necro 
mass to the soil organic matter pool however many cord formers
are also equipped with a suite of extracellular enzymes that con 
tribute to both efficient internal biomass recycling boddy 
falconer et al and degradation of organic complexes in the
soil hobbie agerer hobbie et al b€odeker et al 
 potentially leading to short residence times of c in myce 
lial biomass and necromass the resistance of mycelial necromass
to decomposition similarly varies among fungal species as a conse 
quence of differences in tissue qualities with implications for c
and nitrogen n residence time in soil whereas mycelium with
high chitin and n concentrations generally decomposes within
weeks drigo et al fernandez koide mycelium
with melanized cell walls such as in many root associated ascomy 
cetes robinson smith read may be resistant to
decomposition leading to a higher proportion of the necromass
being preserved in long term humus stores coelho et al 
koide et al fernandez koide 

our earlier study clemmensen et al evaluated the role
of above ground vs below ground inputs for long term soil c
sequestration across a natural boreal forested island chronose 
quence and considered fungal communities only at the level of
dominant life forms i e saprotrophs and root associates here 
we present in depth species level analyses of phylogenetic and
functional shifts in fungal communities across this chronose 
quence and characterize the spatial organization of the fungal
communities in fine scaled organic soil profiles we test the
hypothesis that shifts in species composition and growth forms
within the mycorrhizal fungal community correlate with differ 
ences in c sequestration from root associated mycelium during
successional development of boreal forest further we propose a
conceptual framework for how to mechanistically understand
observed relationships 

materials and methods

sampling and dna preparation

the study was conducted in a boreal forest chronosequence situ 
ated on forested islands in two adjacent lakes lake hornavan
and lake uddjaure ° n to ° n ° e to ° e 
in northern sweden wardle et al a the islands
were all formed from the same parent material following the last
glaciation c yr ago and represented three size classes 
large islands ha medium islands – ha and 
small islands ha supporting information table s the
main disturbance regime on these islands is wildfire through
lightning strike and lightning strikes larger islands more fre 
quently than smaller ones meaning that larger islands burn more
frequently wardle et al the average times since fire are
 and yr on large medium and small islands 
respectively wardle et al each island serves as an inde 
pendent replicate ecosystem with whole islands serving as the
units of replication on average and kg cm� 

have accumulated below ground on large medium and small
islands respectively clemmensen et al detailed
accounts of soil sampling and dna preparation are available in
clemmensen et al in short soil cores cm diameter 
were sampled from each island down to the complete humus
depth of – m eight cores excluding the longest and short 
est were split into cm horizons and the uppermost cm
were further split into two litter l horizons intact litter on the
surface and more degraded intact litter in the upper c – cm of
the core two fragmented litter f horizons c – and – cm
depth and two humus h horizons c – and – cm
depth living roots and rhizomes with a diameter of mm
were removed and materials from the same horizon were pooled
within each island resulting in six to horizons sampled from
each of the islands and a total of soil samples the sam 
ples were freeze dried and dna was extracted from mg of
finely milled material in cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide
 ctab buffer cetyltrimethylammonium bromide mm
edta mm tris hcl and m nacl ph the content
of total extracted dna was measured spectrophotometrically
and fungal dna was estimated by quantitative pcr of the fun 
gal its region using the primers fits and its ihrmark
et al its amplicons for sequencing were produced
using the forward primers fits or gits in separate pcr reac 
tions combined with sample tagged its reverse primers techni 
cal triplicates – cycles ihrmark et al amplicons
were sequenced by lgc genomics gmbh berlin germany 
on a gl flx titanium system roche basel switzerland 

dna sequence analyses

sequences were quality filtered and clustered into operational tax 
onomic units otus that proximately correspond to the species
level distance single linkage using the bioinformatics
pipeline scata http scata mykopat slu se as detailed in fig 
s the entire unite database http unite ut ee abarenkov
et al and a curated selection of sequences from the ncbi
nr database https blast ncbi nlm nih gov were included in the
clustering procedure to provide validation of the species level and
identification of some otus primarily ectomycorrhizal fungi 
based on the same criteria as the clustering the globally most
abundant fungal otus each being represented by at least
 reads and together encompassing of the total reads were
further identified through neighbour joining analyses with refer 
ence sequences as described in detail in fig s and by clemmensen
et al identified otus were categorized into the fungal
guilds litter associated saprotrophs ectomycorrhizal fungi eri 
coid mycorrhizal fungi other root associated fungi moulds and
yeasts based on published literature fungal sequences that could
not be identified to species with known function but that clus 
tered into clades together with reference sequences derived from
a particular substrate i e surface sterilized roots of ectomycorrhi 
zal ericoid or other hosts or litter components were assigned to
putative guilds thus we attempted to define fungal guilds based
on their main source of c with saprotrophic fungi being those
that gain c from dead organic material and root associated fungi

being those that gain c directly from their host plant in cases
where the closest reference sequences were derived from different
substrates the otus were classified as unknown with respect to
guild ectomycorrhizal species were further ascribed to mycelial
exploration types following the categories described by agerer
 and implemented further by tedersoo smith 
the relative abundances of fungal clusters in each sample were
calculated after the removal of all global singletons on average
 of the reads and nonfungal sequence reads on average 
and for the fits and gits primers respectively each
of the samples was represented by on average fits 
plus gits reads when one of the forward primers
clearly disfavoured a cluster relative abundance of that
obtained by the other primer data from the highest yielding
primer were used of clusters affected raw molecular
data are stored at the sequence read archive under the accession
number srp www ncbi nlm nih gov sra representative
sequences for the most abundant otus are deposited in the
unite database under accession codes udb –
udb see table s for identifications and fungal guild
assignments as well as links to unite species hypotheses and
table s for relative abundances across all samples 

to estimate the fungal community as integrated over the
whole soil profile for each island relative abundances were first
multiplied by the total number of internal transcribed spacer
 its copies in each sample communities were then summed
over the complete organic profile and new relative abundances of
all otus calculated based on its copies in the complete profile 
the fungal its copy number was significantly correlated with
the fungal biomarker ergosterol across f and h layer samples 
but not across the l samples which had higher number of its
copies per ergosterol content than did the f and h samples fig 
s thus while our analyses of relative its abundances within
separate horizons and fungal guilds should be largely unaffected
by possible variation in its copy number per biomass baldrian
et al some litter associated fungi may be overrepresented
in the fungal communities as integrated for each island unfortu 
nately no single fungal biomarker has proved to correspond most
closely to real standing biomass baldrian et al and here
we choose to use the same fungal marker i e the its region to
characterize both the fungal communities and their relative bio 
mass in the samples fig s

discussion

it has recently been shown in the studied chronosequence that
 – of the c stored in humus during the past yr origi 
nated from c allocated to roots and associated fungi rather than
from above ground plant litter and that accelerating accumula 
tion of root derived c could explain the increasing rate of c
sequestration with time since fire clemmensen et al 
here we present data documenting successions in fungal commu 
nities both vertically i e from surface litters to deeper humus
layers and with time since fire we observed distinct patterns in
species composition within each of the major fungal guilds across
the chronosequence and identified a specific root associated fun 
gal community in the particular humus layers where c based
estimates indicated high rates of c deposition the composition
of this fungal community was found to correlate with differences
in c dynamics between islands of contrasting fire histories in
multivariate analyses forward selection of explanatory variables
suggested that the effect of island size and thus time since
fire on fungal communities is indirect and mediated by

the other way around based on observed correlations we pro 
pose a conceptual framework for how shifting community

composition of mycorrhizal symbionts during long term
succession of boreal forests might affect n and c dynamics and
therefore soil c sequestration while natural experiments like this

the most obvious difference in fungal community composition

the late successional stage forests on small islands was the higher
contribution by cord forming ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes
 suillus variegatus cortinarius and piloderma spp on the large
islands figs i c cord forming ectomycorrhizal fungi were

ectomycorrhizal fungi are abundant fig the degree to which
such a strategy acts to minimize competition between the symbi 
otic partners in different ecosystems may explain why mycorrhi 
zal fungi in some cases such as in our late successional stage
forests appear to aggravate n limitation of their plant hosts
 alberton et al n€asholm et al whereas in other
cases such as in our early successional stage forests act to
increase both c and n cycling through soil pools drake et al 
 phillips et al 

some of the dominant cord formers in our system and in the
boreal forest in general – the cortinarius species – may also be par 
ticularly efficient at mobilizing organic n from complex organic
polymers hobbie agerer hobbie et al this is
probably a consequence of their production of oxidative exoen 
zymes such as class ii manganese mn peroxidases in response
to low n availability b€odeker et al hence although all
cortinarius species appear to be obligate biotrophs and depend on
their host for easily available sugars they may still act to degrade
organic matter in their search for n see also lindahl tunlid in
press our data also indicate that communities of putative myce 
lium degraders and opportunists including various yeasts and
moulds thrive in the rooting zone of large islands and their activ 
ity could contribute to a higher turnover of dead mycelium and
decomposition residues produced on these islands an overall

consequence of the higher abundance of cord forming ectomycor 
rhizal fungi thus seems to be that a major part of the c allocated
to mycelial growth is turned over rapidly reducing c inputs to
long term storage pools in the soil and facilitating more rapid
recycling of n to the plant biomass fig this may seem coun 
terintuitive as mycelial cords have been found to persist for long
time periods in the soil treseder et al pritchard et al 
 however the cords themselves only account for a minor
fraction of mycelial production in cord forming fungi and the
majority of production consists of diffuse exploratory mycelium
which turns over much more rapidly than the sparse network of
remaining cords finlay read a greater efficiency of
mobilization and transfer of n to the plant hosts is also reflected
by the steeper d n gradient and higher c n ratio in the humus
profiles of large islands clemmensen et al 

ericoid mycorrhizal fungi may mediate c sequestration

ericoid mycorrhizal fungi constituted a major and stable propor 
tion of the amplicon communities across all islands fig k

humus layers of small islands fig s b d where ericoid fungi
dominated suggesting that the standing biomass of these com 
munities was larger on small islands most of the root associated
ascomycetes in boreal forests belong to the helotiales or chae 
tothyriales and form short ranging nonaggregated mycelia of
dark hyphae with thick melanized cell walls that are well pro 
tected against adverse environmental conditions such as desicca 
tion and fluctuating temperatures butler day 
robinson grelet et al fernandez koide 
these hyphae are likely to be characterized by slow growth rob 
inson smith read and long life span koide
et al melanized hyphae are also likely to have cell walls
that are more resistant to degradation coelho et al butler
 day than the exploratory hyphae produced by most ec 
tomycorrhizal basidiomycetes we postulate that these character 
istics lead to a larger proportion of fungal necromass being
preserved in long term humus stores on small islands in which
root associated ascomycetes dominate root zone processes
 fig previously we have shown that c accumulation at late
successional stages depends on accumulation of mycelial remains 
as indicated by high concentrations of the fungal cell wall compo 
nent chitin in the humus clemmensen et al however 
chitin is relatively labile under both laboratory and field condi 
tions drigo et al fernandez koide russell 
 and instead differences in melanin concentration influ 
ence variation in mycelial recalcitrance to decomposition fer 
nandez koide fungal melanins have been found to
associate with more labile components of fungal cell walls such
as proteins and chitin and may form physical and chemical com 
plexes that may be well protected against decomposition coelho
et al butler day hence we propose that stress 
tolerant root associated ascomycetes play a central role in the
formation of boreal forest humus 

the most intensively studied ericoid mycorrhizal fungal spe 
cies r ericae grows well on fungal necromass as a sole n source
 kerley read and ericoid fungi have long been thought
to be more efficient mobilizers of organic n relative to ectomy 
corrhizal fungi read et al however lower c n and
 n n ratios but higher chitin content of the humus on small
islands indicate that less efficient recirculation of n to plants is
linked to mycelial necromass build up clemmensen et al 
 supposedly by ericoid mycorrhizal fungi thus in con 
trast to read et al we propose that ericoid mycorrhizal
fungi may lock up more c and n than they release from the
long term soil organic matter pool primarily as a result of
impaired decomposition of their necromass there was a distinct
transition in community composition within the guilds of puta 
tive ericoid mycorrhizal and other root associated ascomycetes
across the island gradient fig d it is possible that these root 
associated ascomycetes cover a wide spectrum of lifestyles from
facultative to obligate mycorrhizal biotrophs and that they form
structurally and functionally different associations with various
host species e g vohnik et al grelet et al vohnik
 albrechtova for example the two melanized ascomy 
cetes cenococcum geophilum and meliniomyces vraolstadiae were
found preferentially in early successional forests probably

because their ectomycorrhizal habit link their abundance to the
production of their host trees interspecific differences in melanin
production and mycelial dynamics may be important for c
sequestration and deserve particular future research attention 

shifting vertical distribution of litter associated fungi

litter layers were clearly dominated by saprotrophs with a suc 
cession from a few dominant ascomycete litter endophytes e g 
ceutospora pinastri lophodermium pinastri in the younger litters 
to basidiomycete saprotrophs mainly mycena spp in the more
decomposed litters fig saprotrophic communities were
largely confined to the litter layers supporting previous studies
and showing that vertical separation of saprotrophic and root 
associated communities is a widespread phenomenon in ectomy 
corrhizal dominated ecosystems lindahl et al baldrian
et al mcguire et al however both litter associ 
ated basidiomycetes and ascomycetes were more abundant at
greater depths on small islands than on large islands fig e f 
table s corresponding to the slower decomposition of above 
ground litter components on small islands wardle et al 
additionally reduced competition from ectomycorrhizal cord
formers in the fragmented litter layers on the small islands may
have allowed the litter fungi to persist at greater depths in a man 
ner similar to the competitive release of saprotrophic communi 
ties shown to occur after root trenching to exclude roots of
ectomycorrhizal tree species gadgil gadgil in contrast
to the litter layers saprotrophic fungal communities in the
humus layers were dominated by yeasts and moulds particularly
on large islands wood decay fungi appear to be confined mainly
to discrete patches of woody debris in this system 

coordinated above ground and below ground successions

the most abundant cord forming ectomycorrhizal fungi in our
system fig c live exclusively in symbiosis with pinus i e 
suillus variegatus cortinarius semisanguineus c mucosus or
betula i e c armillatus pinus and betula dominate the earlier
succession stages after wildfire wardle et al and could
thereby contribute to the higher abundance of these cord form 
ing species on larger islands the increasing relative contribution
of ericaceous dwarf shrubs to total net primary productivity with
time since fire wardle et al might explain the sustained
high relative abundance of ericoid mycorrhizal ascomycetes as
island size decreases fig k conversely fungal successions fol 
lowing wildfire may also play a central role in driving changes in
the plant community the increasing importance of stress 
adapted traits during long term succession in the prolonged
absence of disturbances such as fire and with declining soil fertil 
ity is probably highly coordinated between plant and fungal
communities the greater fungal species diversity in the late suc 
cessional stage forests matches observations of plant diversity
 wardle et al a further highlighting the parallel develop 
ment of above ground and below ground community responses 

the declining net primary productivity associated with
prolonged absence of fire in our study system wardle et al

 a suggests that absolute c allocation to root associated fungi
would be largest early in the succession cord forming ectomycor 
rhizal fungi have been proposed to be the most c demanding of all
mycorrhizal types owing to their extensive mycelial production
 hobbie their supposedly high production of enzymes
would lead to a high energy demand and their maintenance in the
fungal community may depend on sufficient quantities of c being
allocated below ground the high demand for host derived c by
these cord forming fungi would be matched by a more efficient
supply of nutrients back to their hosts leading to a positive feed 
back between the two partners and a higher primary production
 fig thus both vegetation composition and productivity are
likely to be important drivers of the observed differences in root 
associated fungal communities between the large and small islands 

taken together our observations provide evidence that long 
term successional development and accompanying humus build up
in the forest chronosequence occurs in concert with phylogenetic
and morphological shifts in the mycorrhizal fungal community
with potential consequences for c and n cycling fig we pro 
pose that these fungal community changes play an important role
in explaining the large accumulation of organic matter below
ground that is often observed in older ecosystems while stress 
adapted root associated ascomycetes generally seem to promote
biochemical stabilization of c and n in organic matter derived
from mycelium the higher abundance of certain cord forming ec 
tomycorrhizal fungi at earlier successional stages implies efficient
recycling of n and c from both recently produced fungal mycelium
and older humus long term ecosystem succession thus involves
impairment of mycorrhizal n recirculation and consequently pro 
gressive nutrient limitation and compositional changes in the vege 
tation with time since fire alberton et al wardle et al 
 a changes in plant community composition in turn influ 
ence total below ground allocation of c and relative c allocation to
different fungal symbionts as a consequence of specificity in the
plant–fungal interactions these feedbacks result in increasing c
and n accumulation in the humus layer and reduced plant produc 
tion over time – a pathway that can only be reset by major distur 
bances such as wildfire
