abstract

next generation sequencing technology has revolutionised microbiology by allowing concurrent analysis of whole
microbial communities here we developed and verified similar methods for the analysis of fungal communities using a
proton release sequencing platform with the ability to sequence reads of up to bp in length at significant depth this
read length permits the sequencing of amplicons from commonly used fungal identification regions and thereby taxonomic
classification using the bp sequencing capability we have sequenced amplicons from the its its and lsu fungal
regions to a depth of approximately raw reads per sample representative operational taxonomic units otus were
chosen by the usearch algorithm and identified taxonomically through nucleotide blast blastn combination of this
sequencing technology with the bioinformatics pipeline allowed species recognition in two controlled fungal spore
populations containing members of known identity and concentration each species included within the two controlled
populations was found to correspond to a representative otu and these otus were found to be highly accurate
representations of true biological sequences however the absolute number of reads attributed to each otu differed
among species the majority of species were represented by an otu derived from all three genomic regions although in
some cases species were only represented in two of the regions due to the absence of conserved primer binding sites or
due to sequence composition it is apparent from our data that proton release sequencing technologies can deliver a
qualitative assessment of the fungal members comprising a sample the fact that some fungi cannot be amplified by
specific ‘‘conserved’’ primer pairs confirms our recommendation that a multi region approach be taken for other amplicon 
based metagenomic studies

introduction

the fungal kingdom is highly diverse and includes taxa from

numerous different ecological niches with varied life history

strategies and morphologies ranging from unicellular yeasts and

microscopic moulds to large mushrooms the number of formally

described fungal species is over with greater than 

named species in the british isles alone however estimates of the

number of species globally is believed to be at least million but

probably as many as million spores are one of the

mechanisms used by fungi for dispersal most of which are wind 

borne and vary greatly in size morphology and method of release 

with both passive and active spore liberation methods fungi are

an essential component of the ecosystem and have major

economic value both positively commercial exploitation for

drugs food stuff fuel pesticides etc and negatively as plant

and animal pathogens and play an important role in human

health as allergens pathogens and commensals 

traditional methods for identifying microscopic fungi and

airborne fungal spores rely on culture or morphological identifi 

cation by microscopy culture dependant methods inevitably

underestimate diversity and grossly bias studies towards fungi

that can be cultured on generic fungal growth media estimates

suggest that of the known fungi only can be readily grown in

culture and of those many will produce only sterile mycelium

 bridge and spooner in clinical studies reliance on culture

can miss potentially important fungi microscopy is less prone

to bias however many spores cannot be distinguished from each

other based upon their morphology alone of the or so fungal

categories that can be recognised some can be classified to genus 

a few to species but many have to be recorded in groups with

similar characteristics 

the development of molecular techniques that utilise polymer 

ase chain reaction pcr to amplify regions of the fungal genome

thought to be specific to a particular species provided the first

culture independent means of detecting microorganisms ampli 

con based fungal metagenomic studies target various regions of the

nuclear ribosomal operon rdna which is present in multiple

copies contains both highly conserved and variable regions and

for which numerous universal primers exist the fungal ribosomal

operon consists of the small subunit ssu or s s and the

large subunit lsu or s s s separated by an internal

transcribed spacer its region comprising two sections its 

and its that bracket the conserved s three prime of the

lsu is the s ribosomal gene flanked by two intergenic spacer

regions igs and respectively 

early culture free molecular studies of fungi – required the

amplification of fungal dna using conserved oligonucleotide

primers and utilised the sequencing method of sanger to

determine the sequence of the resulting amplicons sanger

sequencing provided the long read length bp and base 
calling accuracy required for such analyses however was

unsuitable for the generation of sufficient sequencing data termed

sequencing depth to resolve complex microbial systems common 

ly associated with environmental sampling in a reasonable

timeframe the introduction of next generation sequencing

revolutionised microbial metagenomics by providing much greater

sequencing depth this however tended to be at the expense of

read length with some next generation platforms generating sub 

 bp reads the early fungal amplicon based metagenomic

studies relied on expensive sequencing to enable the

generation of reads long enough for species discrimination –

 however the recent availability of affordable ‘‘bench top’’

machines with sufficient read length has placed the ability to

generate millions of sequencing reads into the hands of small to

medium sized research laboratories several high throughput

sequencing platforms are now available differing most signifi 

cantly in the length and depth of sequence they generate and in

their ‘‘error profile’’ choice of sequencing platform therefore

represents a complex decision involving read length read depth 

base calling accuracy systematic error profile and of course

economics 

during the year of a post light proton release sequencing

platform announced the ability to sequence reads up to bp in

length at significant depth several millions of reads within a

period of hours these specifications permit sequencing of

amplicons from the its regions and and the d d region

of the lsu providing the maximum sequence length for

speciation and therefore lend themselves to fungal amplicon 

based metagenomic applications in this study we sought to

validate the use of proton release sequencing data generated on a

bench top sequencer to analyse mixed fungal samples using two

controlled populations containing members of known identity and

known concentration

two controlled mock fungal populations were created the first

dextrose agar oxoid until confluent and sporulating spores were

harvested by inoculating plates with ml filter sterilised 

tween sigma aldrich and filtering the fungal suspension

through a whatman filter of pore size mm the concentration
of suspended spore stocks was determined by counting in a

haemocytometer chamber at magnification all spore stocks
were determined by microscopic analysis to be composed of

 spores as opposed to mycelial cells or conidiophores 
aliquots of individual spore stocks were mixed and diluted in 

tween to give a final concentration of approximately

 reads representing full length amplicons com 
prising the entire expected sequence were retained for further

analysis table on average approximately of the raw
reads obtained were found to represent full length amplicons in

general the sequencing of shorter amplicons for example its 

mean length bp tended to produce more full length reads
than longer amplicons for example the d d region of lsu 

mean length bp until very recently proton release
sequencing technology has been limited to read lengths of

 bp rendering it unsuitable for comprehensive its or
lsu assessment whilst a recent august publication

implemented bp proton release sequencing for the assessment

of fungal diversity in soil this analysis was restricted to the its 

region due to sequence length constraints and further considered

only the first bp of this region in contrast we consider

full length sequence data from three genomic regions which

provides additional genetic information for identification at the

species level 

to reduce data redundancy all reads were dereplicated by

merging identical reads whilst retaining cluster size information in

order to reduce the impact of sequencing errors on otu

formation full length reads were denoised merging reads with

up to errors whilst retaining cluster size information so that the

total number of reads available for analysis remained the same at

this stage clusters comprising less than individual reads

 representing a maximum of of the full length sequence

data were discarded based upon the hypothesis that more

abundant sequences are likely to be accurate biological sequences 

whilst rare sequences are likely to contain sequencing errors or be

due to pcr artefacts denoising reduced the total number of

unique reads by an average of table 

clustering of denoised ion torrent reads at an identity of 

and therefore considering sequences within a distance of each

other to belong to a single otu generated between and 

otus for the member mock population and between and 

for the mock population known to contain species depending

on which genomic region was considered table in all
instances the more variable its region appeared to

generate the most otus and the least variable lsu region the

fewest considering all samples an average otu to species ratio

of was observed further investigation revealed that the
additional otus were the result of each single species being

represented by more than one otu rather than additional

‘‘incorrect’’ species being identified each species was represented

by a ‘‘major otu’’ which accounted for approximately of

the reads assigned to that organism and various significantly

smaller otus which clustered separately due to the presence of

insertion deletion indel errors often associated with homo 

polymeric regions please refer to file s and file s in all
cases the major otu showed the highest identity to the true

biological sequence with the additional smaller otus displaying

base mis matches due to indels such data are of great

significance to metagenomic studies that commonly use otu

counts to infer species richness failure to carefully characterise the

otu to species ratio using mock communities such as is

presented herein can therefore lead to vast under or over

estimations of species diversity despite the publication of

numerous ngs driven metagenomic studies the vast majority

concerning bacteria there is still a relative paucity of studies

characterising such metrics in mock fungal communities

database without restriction i e this search was not limited to the

fungi in the mock populations otus were categorised as

‘‘perfect’’ errors ‘‘good’’ ‘‘noisy’’ ‘‘contam 
inant’’ high identity to a true biological sequence not included

within the mock population or ‘‘other’’ the vast majority
of otus were categorised as ‘‘perfect’’ or ‘‘good’’ suggesting that

highly accurate otus could be reconstructed from the denoised

ion torrent sequencing data table 

finally we determined whether the annotated otus as above 

accurately reflected the mock community members in the gm

and sm samples based upon the three metagenomic regions

considered each mock community member successfully repre 

sented by an otu and the taxonomic classification afforded is

recorded in table in the vast majority of cases an
otu representing each of the mock community members was

present in the sequencing data from all three genomic regions for

 of the community members representative otus were detected

by genomic regions table designed ‘‘n’’ but were absent
from the sequencing data in the third in the gm specimen 

fusarium moniliforme was not detected by its but was detected in

both the its and lsu sequencing data subsequent sequence

analysis revealed a mismatch between this organism and the

forward its primer preventing efficient amplification and

resulting in any sequencing data being lost at the adapter trimming

stage where a primer match was required in the sm

specimen cryptococcus victoriae and penicillium fellutanum were not

detected by its whilst aspergillus ochraceus and cryptococcus

neoformans were not detected by lsu amplification of the its 

region from cryptococcus victoriae resulted in only partial reads of

approximately bases in length however no clear sequence

composition issue was evident amplification of this region in

penicillium fellutanum also failed to generate full length reads

however this was likely due to two homopolymeric regions

consisting of thymine residues and cytosine residues

respectively amplification products from the lsu region of

aspergillus ochraceus and cryptococcus neoformans were also absent 

retrospective analysis of the raw sequencing data confirmed the

absence of any amplification products from either species it is

known that cryptococcus neoformans lacks one of the lsu priming

sites preventing amplification however insufficient sequence

information is available for aspergillus ochraceus to determine

whether this species also lacks one of the required priming sites 

it is clear from these data that no one region was able to identify

all species that comprised the mock communities further

confirming our recommendation that a multi region metagenomic

approach should be taken where possible an alternative strategy

would be to utilise a single marker multi primer approach or

even a multi marker multi primer approach to increase the

probability of detecting a given species following identification 

the absolute number of reads mapping to each otu representing

each community member was determined and is shown in

 figure each species was included at an equal spore
concentration within the two mock communities table 
however the absolute number of reads mapping to each of the

species varied by several orders of magnitude for many species

the proportion of reads attributed to that species within the mock

communities was similar between the three regions for example

epicoccum nigrum and aspergillus flavus were the most abundant

species in mock communities gm and sm respectively for all

three regions however for others abundance proportion varied

more substantially figure 

discussion

it is apparent from our data that proton release sequencing

technology can deliver a qualitative assessment of the fungal

members comprising a sample when carefully applied and when

paired with appropriate bioinformatic analysis we used a multi 

region approach to investigate any potential targeting bias which

could arise when reliant on a single region during the early years

of barcoding the its region became the default marker for species

level studies for most fungi with the exception of the yeasts where

the lsu became the standard for identification given

that yeasts and filamentous fungi are abundant in nearly all

environments including the human body we chose to use the

variable d d region of the lsu and both its regions

 it is clear from our study that whilst there were differences in

read abundance proportion attributed to the different species

between the three regions the main concern was that no single

region was able to identify all species that comprised the mock

communities confirming our recommendation that a multi region

metagenomic approach should be taken where possible using a

multi region approach all species could be identified however 

quantification is more difficult to achieve as indicated by the

apparent discordance between spore number and read count 

other studies have highlighted potential amplification biases

dependent on the choice of its primers used and an alternative

to our multi region approach is the multi primer approach

targeting different parts of the its region in parallel 

however as the authors themselves point out targeting the whole

of its or its biases the results towards the ascomycota 

targeting only its may lead to a preferential amplification of

‘non dikarya’ fungi the dikarya being the subkingdom of fungi

that includes ascomycota and basidiomycota which together

represent about of described fungal species it is generally

accepted that for the majority of the fungal kingdom its is the

preferred barcode region but that other supplementary regions

may be needed lsu can often discriminate species

independently or more so combined with its and for yeasts

the d d region of lsu was adopted for characterising species

before dna barcoding became popular given that its

sequences can be shared between different species such as

cladosporium penicillium fusarium and aspergillus four genera of

both economical and clinical relevance we opted to take a multi 

region approach to include its its and the d d region of

lsu data from other studies indicate that its and lsu perform

very similarly as barcodes and that differences in these sequences

correlate well with current species concepts irrespective of

approach numerous primer combinations are reported within the

literature and it is important to determine the most optimal

primer set or combination for each particular application 

this study used two mock fungal populations selected to address

different questions the gm reference mixture was used to

reflect different genera that produce spores that are readily found

in air samples it was utilised for this study as it reflects a

diverse mixture of fungal genera that produce spores of different

sizes and complexity and simultaneously allow the direct

comparison of the high throughput sequencing data generated in

this study with data produced using the more traditional clone

library preparation and sanger sequencing approach the sm

reference mixture was chosen to comprise closely related species

that produce single celled spores of a more uniform size from

clinically relevant fungal genera the application of high

throughput sequencing to assessing fungal diversity is of growing

interest in studies of the human microbiome its often has

insufficient variation to unequivocally identify species in species 

rich ascomycete genera such as penicillium sm includes

several species of aspergillus penicillium and cryptococcus and one

species of the genus paecilomyces a genus that is genetically close to

both aspergillus and penicillium and therefore better represents the
types of species that might be found in a human microbiome study

compared to gm in addition sm comprises species that

produce single celled spores of a fairly uniform size unlike gm 

the fungal rdna region which is the molecular target of

choice for fungal amplicon based metagenomic studies given the

existence of priming sites which are highly conserved across large

groups of organisms enables the amplification and detection of a

wide range of taxa this fungal rdna region is multicopy in

nature occurring numerous times throughout the fungal genome 

whilst multiple gene copies increase sensitivity by effectively

amplifying the genomic signal from each fungal spore it has been

shown that copy number differs considerably between fungi from

tens to several hundred and will therefore impact upon the

final number of sequencing reads attributed to each fungi 

attempts have been made to enumerate copy number in pcr

studies by empirically determining the rdna copy number

relative to a single copy number gene and have confirmed

figure read distributions the number of sequencing reads assigned to each species expressed as a percentage of the total
number of sequencing reads 
doi journal pone g 

ion torrent driven fungal metagenomics

plos one www plosone org april volume issue e 



that copy number does indeed vary by species dividing the

number of sequencing reads by the copy number represents a

plausible method of normalising next generation sequencing data 

however methods for the empirical calculation of rdna copy

number are only suitable for the detection and enumeration of a

restricted set of fungi where individual pure cultures are available 

and are therefore presently unsuitable for the large scale

metagenome studies arising as the result of next generation

sequencing availability 

differences in dna extraction efficiency between the different

fungal spore types and the bias towards shorter amplicons

inherent in pcr reactions may also affect the number of

sequencing reads attributed to each fungi black and colleagues

recently reported large variations in detectable target when pcr

was conducted on dna extracted from known quantities of spores

 suggesting that dna is not released from all spores with equal

efficiency although differences in dna extraction efficiency and

pcr bias are likely to contribute less to differences in absolute

read abundance than the effect of rdna copy number variation 

no comprehensive assessment in commonly encountered fungal

spores has yet been conducted 

a further consideration is spore size and complexity which is of

particular relevance to the gm mock community formulated

from fungi with a diverse range of spore sizes the smaller sized 

single celled spores from aspergillus fumigatus and penicillium

chrysogenum were represented at much lower read numbers than

the multicellular large spores from alternaria alternata leptosphaeria

coniothyrium and epicoccum nigrum table and figure the

second mock population was however created solely from single

celled spores of approximately to mm diameter and the
