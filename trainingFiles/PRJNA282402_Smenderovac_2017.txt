emily e smenderovac kara webster john caspersen dave morris paul hazlett and nathan basiliko

abstract intensified biomass harvesting in northern forests could potentially negatively impact soils this study measured
microbial community structure and function to assess the impacts of intensified biomass removal on soil from a managed
northern jack pine pinus banksiana lamb forest in ontario canada four clear cut harvesting removal intensities were com 
pared with uncut controls and mature fire regenerated forest reference plots stem only removal full tree biomass removal 
full tree biomass with stump removal and full tree biomass with stump removal and soil blading that eliminated all aboveg 
round and much belowground organic matter a nearby recently burned forest site representing common natural disturbance
in the region was also studied within the first two years after harvesting there were significant differences in community
structure and degradation of various c compounds among all harvested and unharvested sites but little difference in commu 
nities across the different harvest intensities communities within the fire site were not comparable with those of harvested
treatments indicating that clear cut logging may not initially produce an ecologically comparable disturbance with that of fire 
although this conclusion is based on only one fire disturbance site in the two years after harvesting an important time for
seedling establishment in managed forest systems it appears that intensification of harvesting does not further disrupt micro 
bial community structure and functioning beyond impacts from current harvest practices

résumé la récolte intensive de biomasse dans les forêts nordiques pourrait avoir un impact négatif sur les sols cette étude a
mesuré la structure et le fonctionnement des communautés microbiennes pour évaluer les impacts de la récolte intensive de
biomasse sur le sol d’une forêt aménagée de pin gris pinus banksiana lamb dans le nord de l’ontario au canada nous avons
comparé des peuplements témoins non récoltés et des parcelles de référence dominées par des forêts matures régénérées par le
feu à quatre intensités de récolte par coupe à blanc récolte des troncs seulement récolte par arbres entiers récolte par arbres
entiers avec enlèvement des souches et récolte par arbres entiers avec enlèvement des souches et coupe à la cisaille pour
éliminer toute la matière organique sur le sol et une grande partie de la matière organique sous la surface du sol nous avons
aussi étudié une station forestière adjacente ayant récemment brûlé représentative d’une perturbation naturelle fréquente dans
la région au cours des deux premières années qui ont suivi la récolte nous avons détecté des différences significatives dans la
structure des communautés et la dégradation de plusieurs composés carbonés entre les stations non récoltées et l’ensemble des
stations récoltées mais peu de différences dans les communautés entre les différentes intensités de récolte les communautés
présentes dans la station brûlée n’étaient pas comparables à celles des stations récoltées ce résultat indique qu’initialement la
coupe à blanc ne serait pas une perturbation écologiquement comparable au feu bien que cette conclusion soit basée sur une
seule station brûlée au cours des deux années suivant la récolte qui correspondent à une période importante pour
l’établissement des semis dans les systèmes forestiers aménagés il semble que l’intensification de la récolte n’accentue pas
davantage la perturbation de la structure et du fonctionnement des communautés microbiennes au delà des impacts liés aux
pratiques forestières courantes traduit par la rédaction

energy production beyond their own usage in canadian silvicul 
tural systems it is generally not profitable to manage and harvest
forests exclusively for energy production via biomass boilers and
thus any additional bioenergy feedstock supply must come from
increased biomass removal during harvest for pulpwood or sawlogs
 natural resources canada additional biomass removed
through harvesting intensification may include small branches
and attached leaves and larger coarse woody debris which are
widely acknowledged as important components of forest ecosys 
tems contributing to organic matter retention nutrient cycling 
and habitat supply harmon et al as a result the removal of
this coarse and fine organic matter may have implications with
respect to the nutrient status of the soil and future site productivity 

fungi and bacteria carry out important roles in northern forest
soils in the majority of boreal shield forests in canada soils are
coarser textured and nutrient poor thus decomposition of har 
vest slash plant litter and soil organic matter mediated by both
mycorrhizae and free living saprobes provides an important sup 
ply of nutrients for tree growth physical disturbances associated
with clear cut logging have been reported to impact soil microbial
communities chatterjee et al hynes and germida 
and studies have recently reported changes in community char 
acteristics due to increased intensity of harvest harmon et al 
 kataja aho et al hartmann et al in contrast 
other studies have seen only general harvesting impacts and
negligible subsequent impacts from increased slash removals
 mariani et al allmér et al it may be that the tech 
niques applied in these studies did not have sufficient sensitivity
to detect the changes that might have been occurring differences
in soil microbial communities in western canadian sub boreal
spruce and interior douglas fir forest soils with and without harvest 
ing and soil organic matter removal were reported by hartmann
et al who used high throughput sequencing bacterial com 
munities were relatively unaffected by logging practices while
particular groups of fungi — both purported ectomycorrhizal
symbionts and free living saprobes — were quite different between
uncut controls and clearcuts and less responsive to the physical
disturbances of organic matter removal and compaction within
treatment plots in clear cut logging systems across canada’s vast
boreal forests seedlings are ideally planted shortly after logging
operations are completed to facilitate conifer regrowth over low 
value fast growing broadleaf plants therefore even short term
impacts brought about by new biomass harvesting practices have
the potential to influence microorganisms that could benefit
seedling establishment and forest ecosystem regeneration lehto
and zwiazek kernaghan and patriquin 

in this study we examined how increased biomass removals
within jack pine pinus banksiana lamb forests affect the commu 
nity structure biomass and functioning of soil bacteria and fungi 
we used a replicated randomized block harvest experiment to
compare unharvested jack pine plantation plots with four levels
of biomass removal we also measured these indicators in a ma 
ture fire origin jack pine stand that had never been managed and
a recently burned jack pine stand to more generally compare
microbial communities in managed forests with those under nat 
ural growth and disturbance regimes we used molecular finger 
printing including high throughput sequencing of phylogenetic
marker genes to examine microbial taxa and substrate induced
respiration and enzyme activity assays to assess changes in func 
tioning within the soil communities we predicted that reduced
residual organics on the forest floor and increased mechanical
disturbance in intensified biomass removal operations would alter
the soil chemical environment and in turn microbial community
structure and function further reduced amounts and quality of
organic residuals in and on soils would alter microbial enzymatic
hydrolysis of macromolecules and oxidation of lignin to more
bioavailable moieties potentially impacting long term organic
matter turnover and associated nutrient availability we also pre 

dicted that harsher conditions in harvested sites e g soil dis 
turbed by trenching higher winds greater solar radiation would
reduce microbial biomass and lead to microbial communities
with fewer dominant taxa adapted to relatively more adverse
conditions

 climate data chapleau receives an average of mm of
precipitation per year and has an average temperature range of
– to °c throughout the year environment canada prior
to harvesting in the site was occupied by a year old jack
pine plantation the treatment area was a relatively flat glacio 
fluvial outwash deposit of medium to coarse sands belonging to
the brunisolic order there were four applied treatments stem 
only harvest so where only the bole of each tree was removed 
leaving stumps and upper branches on site after harvest full tree
biomass harvest ft where the entirety of each tree including
traditionally nonmerchantable trees upwards from the stump
was removed stumped ft s where the full tree biomass har 
vest was followed by stump and partial root removal and bladed
 ft b which consisted of a full tree biomass harvest and stump 
ing and removal of the forest floor and roots by blading five
replicates of each biomass harvesting intensity were performed
on randomly distributed blocks of land within the treatment area 
and five uncut control uc plots were placed within an area bor 
dering the treatment plots within each block individual treat 
ment plots are separated by approximately m also m of
harvested forest was included between the plots and the uncut
forest to minimize edge effects in the treatment plots 

after site preparation disc trenching in the summer of 
each × m plot was planted in may half planted with jack
pine and the other half planted with black spruce picea mariana
 mill britton sterns poggenb each subplot was split and half
was treated with glyphosate in august to suppress broadleaf
plant growth prior to planting plots in a year old fire origin
stand of jack pine km southeast of the harvesting trials were
sampled as mature natural comparison mn a fire site fi con 
sisting of a year old jack pine plantation km northwest of
the harvesting plots was also sampled it was burned by wildfire in
may the five sampling plots in the fire and mature sites were
established with plot spacing similar to that of the uc plots al 
though the uc mn and fi plots were not included in the random 
ized replicated experimental design the five replicate sampling
locations were compared with the main treatment plots to ex 
plore harvesting impacts as opposed to other between site differ 
ences greater details concerning the study sites are described in

indicator species from the bradyrhizobiaceae and hyphomicrobi 
aceae families known to contain nitrogen fixing soil organisms
were associated with organic horizons in so and fi treatments in
organic horizons the highest abundance of many indicator spe 
cies was in the fi plots many fungal indicator species in mineral
horizons had higher abundance in ft b ft s and uc treat

organic horizons varied greatly in abundance with several otus
associated with uc treatments and several responding to the fire
disturbance many otus that had larger differences in abundance
were purportedly heterotrophic associated with the genera

longing to the genera hygrophorus and piloderma were also more
abundant in the uc organic horizons in mineral horizons a chy

communities relative to unharvested controls particularly in the
surface organic horizons however we observed few community
structure differences among intensified harvesting treatments 
this may be due to woody debris not yet being fully incorporated
into the soil or because microbial communities had not had suf 
ficient time to respond to different levels of inputs and organic
matter retention kwiaton et al as time since initial distur 
bance increases community structural differences associated
with intensified biomass removal may still emerge for example 
leachate chemistry changes from coarse woody debris decay occur
over a period of multiple years kruys et al spears and
lajtha differences may emerge as coarse woody debris lea 
chates from decay influence the underlying soil chemistry spears
et al alternatively the microbial communities may prove
to be resilient or resistant across the gradient of organic matter
removals beyond the overall harvesting impacts werner et al 
 enzyme activities may have been more responsive to short 
term changes as enzymatic responses have been shown to occur
on faster time scales and in response to subtle changes in environ 
mental conditions or resources relative to changes in microbial
community structure shade et al further monitoring will
be required to determine if differences among biomass removal
intensity treatments become evident in subsequent years some
studies have shown that community differences developed up to
 years after harvesting hartmann et al while other stud 
ies showed that differences remain undetectable shestak and
busse mariani et al 

clear cut harvesting impacts on microbial community
function and structure

the slightly different chemical composition of unharvested
compared with harvested treatments corresponded to higher mi 
crobial biomass it is likely that these differences in chemistry and
biomass can be attributed to the presence of intact forest floor
vegetation mats living trees and reduced exposure of soils to
wind and solar radiation as well as higher transpiration and thus
less potential for surface soil erosion and leaching losses of sol 
utes in the unharvested sites differences could be exacerbated by
physical soil disturbances across all harvest treatments microbial
biomass impacts the magnitude of microbial activity as a larger
microbial biomass has the capability of producing more enzymes 
soil chemical properties also impact enzymatic activities as the
amount and types of carbon and nutrient substrates determine
what enzymes are produced by microorganisms based on these
relationships the lower enzymatic activities in the organic hori 
zons of harvested treatments having lower biomass and altered
chemical composition are expected similar patterns have been
seen in studies by li et al and liu et al though they
were studying potential metabolic impacts of long term organic
matter removal findings from cardenas et al were also
consistent with our short term findings of reduced activity 

harvesting had a large influence on microbial community func 
tioning in mineral soil horizons uc had higher respiration of
sugars and amino acids than harvested treatments these sub 
strates would be more abundant in the rhizosphere environment

the physical impacts of vegetation loss and site preparation
could have influenced microbial community structure as well 
microbial communities generally respond to vegetation as cer 
tain bacteria and fungi participate in both specific and more gen 
eral mutualistic associations with plants huang et al some
of these specific interactions were likely disrupted by harvesting 
otus likely representing ectomycorrhizal fungi were more abun 
dant in control sites the absence of possible mycorrhizal species
in harvested sites could mean loss of phosphorus relocation via
hyphal networks and fewer mycorrhizal relationships in har 
vested plots smith and read general heterotrophic soil
microorganisms can also be influenced by the root exudates that
accompany live vegetation huang et al organic horizons in
harvested plots had reduced abundance of some heterotrophic
genera though it is likely that these organisms were taking ad 
vantage of plant supplied sugars loss of potentially important
heterotrophs could reduce the rate of organic matter turnover
and impact future soil productivity physical disturbances such as
higher soil temperatures altered soil moisture compaction and
mixing introduced by harvesting also alter soil microbial commu 
nity composition and may have further contributed to the ob 
served shifts in community structure mariani et al the

harvesting impact on community structure that appeared in or 
ganic horizons after two years implies a lag in microbial commu 
nity structure response these results are unsurprising when
considering the time to establish vegetation and the hot and dry
conditions in more investigation needs to be done over the
long term to see if the species reduced in harvested soils are
necessary for essential ecosystem services 

microbial community function and structure is not
influenced by intensification of clear cut harvesting in the
short term

although not consistent intensified harvesting impacts have
been reported in different forest and silvicultural systems but
most studies have used large dispersed plots with high natural
heterogeneity without a complete gradient of removal treatments
 mariani et al hartmann et al harvesting intensity
did not result in additional changes to chemical compositions in
organic or mineral soil horizons this could have been due to the
relatively short time between harvesting and site preparation and
soil sampling it may be that these disturbance effects are so large
that the additional upheaval and mixing that occurred on the flats
of soils in ft s sites did not cause further disturbance as ft s
sites were not distinct from less intensive ft and so harvesting 
webster et al reported that the general trends of respira 
tion in these sites were so ≈ ft ft s ft b as the results of
controlled incubations in our hydrolase assays and substrate 
induced respiration did not reveal differences between the func 
tional capabilities of the harvest treatments it is likely that these
differences seen were due to physical properties of the treatments

in the field rather than biological capability of the microbial com 
munities if the physical conditions were not the force driving
microbial activity one would expect the higher levels of sugars
and cellulose in harvested sites compared with unharvested plots
to have caused increased respiration webster et al it is
important to highlight the findings of higher in situ respiration
activities with less disturbed treatments in webster et al in
this context the ambient conditions created by the retention of
woody debris in treatments regulate the magnitude of soil micro 
bial activity not the substrate selection 

there were no clear differences between microbial community
structures at different harvest intensities it could be argued that
the lack of difference was because of the relatively low resolution
of t rflp analyses compared with the high throughput marker
gene sequencing techniques employed for example in hartmann
et al however the lack of effect was validated with high 
throughput sequencing based fingerprinting as well further al 
though some treatment specific otus for each treatment existed 
they had little effect on overall community composition at the
time of sampling compaction on the site could have limited the
influence of the organic matter removals following hartmann

et al who found that organic matter removal was more
influential in soils with low compaction 

the responses of sequencing derived bacterial and fungal indi 
cator species were inconsistent among harvesting treatments and
did not follow a pattern associated with biomass removal inten 
sity possible fungal symbiont taxa did not respond differentially
among harvesting treatments though all harvesting treatments
had lower abundances of these taxa than controls this low abun 
dance of indicator species and lack of difference in the abundance
of ectomycorrhizal genera hygrophorus and piloderma among har 
vesting treatments may mean that from the perspective of estab 
lishment of plant–microbial associations in soils the impact of
intensified biomass harvests may not be much different from
stem only harvest lodge et al 

other studies have also seen negligible effects of additional
biomass removal as compared with stem only harvesting on
soil fungi these studies however used phospholipid biomarker
fingerprinting approaches that are less discriminant than the mo 
lecular methods applied in this study and were only able to
characterize relative fungal biomass as a portion of overall changes
in microbial community chatterjee et al kataja aho et al

 the region where this study was conducted may have influ 
enced the absence of response to intensification as other boreal
forest studies have also reported minimal effects of biomass har 
vest mariani et al kataja aho et al our experimental
design has accounted for natural variation within harvesting
treatment plots in the island lake sites while some studies with
significant effects of increased biomass harvesting may have had
issues related to spatial variations influencing interpretation of
treatment variations hannam et al the results of this
study do not imply that impacts will not occur in the future 
ultimately we suspect that the short time between harvesting
and sampling was insufficient for effects to emerge 

changes in microbial communities with harvest intensity may
occur over an extended time frame as has been seen in other
systems with biomass removal intensification hartmann et al 
 the lack of community structure response complements
the conclusions derived from soil chemical composition and func 
tional activities short term impacts of biomass intensification in
the clear cut system examined were undetectable the short term
effects investigated in this study may be of greater interest to the
forestry industry in relation to the impact of intensified harvest 
ing on important plant symbionts during the planting stage of a
silvicultural cycle however long term changes could result in a
significantly different microbial consortium in these systems that
could influence site productivity and soil ecology 

clear cut harvesting as an analog for natural disturbance
with the caveat that fire was not a treatment in our random 

ized replicated blocked design and we only sampled one compa 
rably aged wildfire site in the short term clear cut harvesting did
not result in producing similar soil microbial communities as
compared with fire disturbance the abundances of some hypho 
microbiaceae and bradyrhizobiaceae species were higher at the
fire site compared with the controls and harvest treatments 
suggesting that some potential plant symbionts involved in fire
succession may not be stimulated by harvesting there could be
specific interactions occurring between these taxa and fire 
adapted plant species hart et al also the generally hetero 
trophic nature of most of the fire related taxa may provide
nutrient recycling functions through microbial degradation of
remaining fire transformed carbon and nutrient sources that
would otherwise be unavailable for biological use mataix solera
et al these differences in turn may have important eco 
logical implications related to differences in microbial character 
istics as these organisms could be important in successional plant
dynamics and plant diversity bever et al 

conclusions
soil chemical properties and microbial community structure

and function of harvested versus unharvested systems differed 
however intensifying the harvesting process beyond stem only
clearcutting did not cause additional disruptions there were
some indications that changes will emerge in time as nonsignif 
icant patterns existed between controls and treatments and
between sampling years also some microbial taxa even if
relatively rare were linked to treatment differences perhaps
these changes in low abundance indicator species will not impact
plant community establishment in the short term as there is the
possibility of functional redundancy in the system present in the
largely unaffected portion of the microbial community although
limited in our inference space it was also apparent that microbial
community structures resulting from clear cut treatments were
different from those of the one fire site included in our study the
activity and ecology of fire adapted microbes need to be more
thoroughly investigated to effectively determine the ecological
implications of the differences that we observed and whether
these differences would still exist if a more diverse set of fire sites
 e g range in fire intensities were included in the sample design 

many forests have clear cut management regimes and although
changes within microbial communities with intensified biomass
removal do not appear to be a short term phenomenon long term
effects may still occur and require additional longer term studies
of this and similar boreal forest systems
