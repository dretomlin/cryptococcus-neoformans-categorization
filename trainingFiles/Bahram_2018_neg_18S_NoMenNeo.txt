soils harbour some of the most diverse microbiomes on earth 
and are essential for both nutrient cycling and carbon storage 
to understand soil functioning it is necessary to model the 
global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of 
soil microorganisms as well as the biotic and environmental 
associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial 
and fungal soil communities – here we show by leveraging 
metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples 
sites subsamples that bacterial but not fungal genetic 
diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene 
composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than 
with geographic distance we demonstrate that fungi and bacteria 
show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting 
diversity responses to precipitation and soil ph furthermore we 
provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism inferred 
from antibiotic resistance genes in topsoil and ocean habitats 
indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping 
microbial communities our results suggest that both competition 
and environmental filtering affect the abundance composition 
and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities 
indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms 
to global nutrient cycling varies spatially 

bacteria and fungi dominate terrestrial soil habitats in terms of bio 
diversity biomass and their influence over essential soil processes 
specific roles of microbial communities in biogeochemical processes 
are reflected by their taxonomic composition biotic interactions and 
gene functional potential – although microbial biogeography studies 
have focused largely on single taxonomic groups and on how their 
diversity and composition respond to local abiotic soil factors for 
example ph global patterns and the impact of biotic interactions 
on microbial biogeography remain relatively unexplored in addition to 
constraints imposed by environmental factors biotic interactions may 
strongly influence bacterial communities for example to outcompete 
bacteria many fungal taxa secrete substantial amounts of antimicro 
bial compounds which may select for antibiotic resistant bacteria and 
effectively increase the relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes 
 args here we used metagenomics and dna metabarcoding s 
 s and internal transcribed spacer its rrna gene markers soil 
chemistry and biomass assessments phospholipid fatty acids analyses 
 plfas to determine the relationships among genetic functional 

potential phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity and abundance in 
response to biotic and abiotic factors in topsoil samples covering 
all terrestrial regions and biomes of the world extended data fig   a 
supplementary table  altogether topsoil subsamples were 
collected from ha plots from sites subsamples per site 
harbouring homogeneous vegetation that were minimally affected by 
humans we minimized biases and shortcomings in sampling as well 
as technical variation including batch effects by using highly stand 
ardized collection and processing protocols from the total collection 
 representative sites were selected for this analysis we validated 
our main findings in external datasets including an independent soil 
dataset topsoil samples supplementary table  that followed the 
same sampling and sequencing protocol 

using metagenomics we constructed a gene catalogue for soils 
by combining our newly generated data with published soil metage 
nomes n supplementary table and identified 
unique genes or fragments thereof only of these mil 
lion genes overlapped with those from published genomes and large 
gut and ocean gene catalogues that are much closer to saturation 
 supplementary table indicating that the functional potential of soil 
microbiomes is enormously vast and undersampled for functional 
analysis we annotated genes and functional modules via orthologous 
groups using the eggnog database for each sample we also con 
structed taxonomic profiles at the class and phylum levels for both 
bacteria and fungi from relative abundance of rrna genes in metagen 
omic datasets mitags complemented by operational taxonomic 
units otus that were based on clustering s rrna and its genes 
for soil fungi and s rrna genes for soil bacteria at similarity 
threshold see methods ‘metagenomics and metabarcoding analyses’ 
in total s based bacterial s based and its 
based fungal otus were analysed in the context of geographic space 
and edaphic and climatic parameters were determined for each 
sampling site see methods ‘statistical analyses’ archaea were poorly 
represented in our metabarcoding data  less than of otus and 
metagenomics data less than of mitags and hence are excluded 
from most analyses 

we examined whether the latitudinal diversity gradient ldg a 
trend of increasing diversity from the poles to the tropics seen in many 
macroscopic organisms especially plants applies to microbial global 
distribution patterns we found that contrary to the typical ldg

both taxonomic and gene functional diversity of bacteria peaked at 
mid latitudes and declined towards the poles and the equator as is also 
seen in the global ocean although the pattern was relatively weak 
for taxonomic diversity herein fig   a c extended data figs   b 
the deviation of several bacterial phyla out of from the general 
trends may be explained by responses to edaphic and climate factors 
weakly related to latitude extended data fig   b or contrasting effects 
at lower taxonomic levels supplementary discussion by contrast the 
ldg does apply to overall fungal taxonomic diversity and to three out 
of five fungal phyla when examined separately but not to fungal func 
tional diversity which was lowest in temperate biomes and exhibited 
an inverse unimodal relationship with latitude fig   b d extended 
data fig   c the ldg was negligible for oceanic fungi regression 
analysis p possibly owing to their lower dispersal limitation 
and the paucity of plant associations although fungal taxonomic diver 
sity decreased poleward the total fungal biomass inferred from plfa 
markers and the fungal bacterial biomass ratio increased poleward 
partly owing to a decline in bacterial biomass with increasing latitude 
 extended data fig   a–c 

we tested the extent to which deterministic processes such as com 
petition and environmental filtering that is the niche theory versus 
neutral processes dispersal and drift the neutral theory explain the 
distributions of fungal and bacterial taxa and functions in bacteria 
environmental variation correlated strongly with taxonomic 

composition partial mantel test accounting for geographic distance 
between samples renv geo p and moderately with gene 
functional composition renv geo p whereas the overall 
effect of geographic distance among samples was negligible p 
the weak correlation between geographic and taxonomic as well as 
functional composition suggests that environmental variables are more 
important than dispersal capacity in determining global distributions 
of soil bacteria and their encoded functions as previously suggested 
and observed for oceanic prokaryotes 

for fungi both geographic distance and environmental parameters 
were correlated with taxonomic composition its data rgeo env 
p renv geo p s data rgeo env 
p renv geo p environmental distance but not 
geographic distance correlated with composition of fungal functional 
genes renv geo p as was also observed for bacteria 
the relatively weaker correlation of fungi with environmental variation 
is consistent with results from local scales thus at both global and 
local scales different processes appear to underlie community assembly 
of fungi and bacteria 

to more specifically investigate the association between environ 
mental parameters and the distribution of taxa and gene functions on 
a global scale we used multiple regression modelling see methods 
‘statistical analyses’ we found that bacterial taxonomic diversity com 
position richness and biomass as well as the relative abundance of major 
bacterial phyla can be explained by soil ph nutrient concentration 
and to a lesser extent by climatic variables extended data figs   
supplementary table  the composition of bacterial communities 
responded most strongly to soil ph followed by climatic variables par 
ticularly mean annual precipitation map extended data figs   
this predominant role of ph agrees with studies from local to conti 
nental scales and may be ascribed to the direct effect of ph or related 
variables such as the concentration of calcium and other cations 
the relative abundance of genes that encode several metabolic and 
transport pathways were strongly increased with ph extended data 
fig   c suggesting that there may be greater metabolic demand for 
these functions for bacteria in high nutrient and alkaline conditions 

compared to temperate biomes tropical and boreal habitats con 
tained more closely related taxa at the tip of phylogenetic trees but 
from more distantly related clades extended data fig   d indicating 
a deeper evolutionary niche specialization in bacteria together with 
global biomass patterns extended data fig   a these results suggest 
that soil bacterial communities in the tropics and at high latitudes are 
subjected to stronger environmental filtering and include a relatively 
greater proportion of edaphic niche specialists possibly rendering 
these communities more vulnerable to global change by contrast 
phylogenetic overdispersion in temperate bacterial communities may 
result from greater competitive pressure or nutrient availability as 
predicted by the niche theory 

in contrast to the strong association between bacterial taxonomic 
diversity and soil ph diversity of bacterial gene functions was more 
strongly correlated with map extended data fig   a–h the steeper 
ldg in gene functions than in taxa fig   a c may thus relate to the 
stronger association of specific metabolic functions to climate than 
to local soil conditions although soil and climate variables exhibited 
comparable correlations with fungal taxa the soil carbon to nitrogen 
ratio c n was the major predictor for fungal biomass and relative 
abundance and composition of gene functions extended data figs   g 
 b d supplementary table  we hypothesize that compared to 
bacteria the global distribution of fungi is more limited by resource 
availability owing to specialization for the use of specific compounds 
as substrates and greater energy demand 

we interpret opposing biogeographic trends for bacteria and fungi 
as niche segregation driven by differential responses of bacteria and 
fungi to environmental factors and their direct competition gene 
functional diversity of both bacteria and fungi responded to map and 
soil ph albeit in opposite directions extended data fig   c d g h

pattern of gene functional diversity across the latitudinal gradient that 
is niche differentiation between bacteria and fungi fig   extended 
data fig   although increasing precipitation seems to favour higher 
fungal diversity it is associated with higher bacterial fungal biomass 
and abundance ratios extended data figs   d g f h the increasing 
proportion of fungi towards higher latitudes may be explained by com 
petitive advantages perhaps owing to a greater tolerance to nutrient 
and water limitation associated with potential long distance transport 
by hyphae 

a role of inter kingdom biotic interactions in determining the 
distributions of functional diversity and biomass in fungi and bacteria 
has been suggested previously as competition for resources affects the 
biomass of fungi and bacteria we hypothesized that the bacterial 
fungal biomass ratio is related to the prevalence of fungi and bacterial 
antibiotic resistance capacity because of broader activities of fungi than 
bacteria in using complex carbon substrates as well as increased anti 
biotic production of fungi in high c n environments consistent with 
this hypothesis we found that both fungal biomass and the bacterial 
fungal biomass ratio correlated with the relative abundance of args 
 extended data fig   and that most fungal orthologous group 

subcategories particularly those involved in biosynthesis of antibiotic 
and reactive oxygen species increased with soil c n supplementary 
table  supplementary discussion we also found that the relative 
abundance of args in topsoil is more strongly related to fungal relative 
abundance r p − and bacterial fungal abundance ratio 
 r − p − fig   b than to bacterial relative abundance 
 r p on the basis of mitags which is supported by 
our external validation dataset fungal relative abundance r

discussion —affect the bacterial fungal abundance ratio which in turn 
affects the relative abundance of args at the global scale fig   c 
in line with increased production of antibiotics in high competition 
environments the soil c n ratio was the best predictor for richness of 
fungal functional genes r p − supplementary table  
and bacterial carbohydrate active enzyme cazyme genes involved 
in degrading fungal carbohydrates r p − the relative 
abundance of args was also strongly correlated with c n in the 
external validation dataset r p − 

although the concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance potential 
and the relative abundance of bacteria as potential arg carriers was 
expected the strong correlation of fungal relative abundance with the 
relative abundance of args and in turn bacterial phylogenetic diversity 
may be explained by selection against bacteria that lack args such that 
bacteria surviving fungal antagonism are enriched for args among 
all studied phyla the relative abundance of chloroflexi nitrospirae 
and gemmatimonadetes bacteria on the basis of mitags taxa with 
relatively low genomic arg content supplementary table  were 
most strongly negatively correlated with arg relative abundance 
 fig   a by contrast args were strongly positively correlated with 
the relative abundance of proteobacteria which have the greatest aver 
age number of args per genome among bacteria supplementary 
table  and the fungal phyla ascomycota and zygomycota sensu lato 

 including zoopagomycota and mucoromycota in both the global soil 
and the external validation datasets fig   a b extended data fig   a c 
supplementary table  more specifically its metabarcoding 
revealed increasing relative abundances of args with numerous 
fungal otus supplementary table  particularly those belong 
ing to oidiodendron myxotrichaceae ascomycota and penicillium 
 aspergillaceae ascomycota which are known antibiotic 
producers supplementary discussion among bacterial args 
the relative abundance of efflux pumps and β lactamases which act 
specifically on fungal derived antibiotics were significantly correlated 
to the relative abundance of ascomycota extended data fig   a 
supplementary table  actinobacteria encompassing antibiotic 
producing streptomyces also significantly correlated to arg diversity 
in topsoil supplementary table  together these results suggest 
that relationships between organismal and arg abundances are 
probably the result of selective and or suppressive actions of antibiotics 
on bacteria 

consistent with our observations in topsoil we found evidence 
for antagonism between fungi and bacteria in oceans by reanalysing 
the distribution of args in water samples from the global tara 
oceans project see methods ‘external metagenomic datasets’ 
supplementary table  extended data fig   a the fungus like stra 
menopile class oomycetes water moulds and the fungal phylum 
chytridiomycota constituted the groups most strongly associated 
with the relative abundance of bacterial args fig   a c extended 
data figs   b d b d although there is little direct evidence that 
oomycetes produce antibiotics their high antagonistic activity can 
induce bacteria and other organisms including fungi to produce 
antibiotics supplementary discussion as in topsoil bacterial phy 
logenetic diversity was significantly negatively correlated with the 
relative abundance of args in ocean samples extended data fig   b c 
in addition the relative abundance of args declined with increasing 
distance from the nearest coast in ocean samples extended data 
fig   b which may reflect the effect of a decreasing nutrient gradient 
along distance from the coast on the pattern of bacterial and fungal 
abundance and in turn the abundance of args the agreement of 
results from these disparate habitats suggests that competition for 
resources related to nutrient availability and climate factors drive 
a eukaryotic–bacterial antagonism in both terrestrial and oceanic 
ecosystems 

our results indicate that both environmental filtering and niche dif 
ferentiation determine global soil microbial composition with a minor 
role of dispersal limitation at this scale for limitations see methods 
‘metagenomics and metabarcoding analyses’ in particular the global 
distributions of soil bacteria and fungi were most strongly associated 
with soil ph and precipitation respectively our data further indicate 
that inter kingdom antagonism as reflected in the association of 
bacterial args with fungal relative abundance is also important in 
structuring microbial communities although further studies are 
needed to explicitly address the interplay between the bacterial fungal 
abundance ratio and the abundance of args our data suggest that 
environmental variables that affect the bacterial fungal abundance 
ratio may have consequences for microbial interactions and may favour 
fungi or bacteria driven soil nutrient cycling this unprecedented view 
of the global patterns of microbial distributions indicates that global 
climate change may differentially affect bacterial and fungal commu 
nity composition and their functional potential because acidification 
nitrogen pollution and shifts in precipitation all have contrasting effects 
on topsoil bacterial and fungal abundance diversity and functioning

methods
no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size the experiments 
were not randomized the investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment 
soil sample preparation composite soil samples from sites worldwide 
were collected using highly standardized protocols the sampling was conducted 
broadly across the most influential known environmental gradient that is the 
latitude taking advantage of a global ‘natural laboratory’ to study the impact of 
climate on diversity across vegetation biome and soil types and to enable testing 
of the effects of environmental parameters spatial distance and biotic interactions 
in structuring microbial communities we carefully selected representative sites 
for different vegetation types separated by spatial distances that were sufficient 
to minimize spatial autocorrelation and to cover most areas of the globe total 
dna was extracted from g of soil from each sample using the powermax soil 
dna isolation kit mobio a subset of high quality dna samples represent 
ing different ecoregions spanning multiple forest grassland and tundra biomes 
 supplementary table  were chosen for prokaryote and eukaryote metabar 
coding ribosomal rrna genes and whole metagenome analysis samples from 
desert n g g s s s s s and s and man 
grove n g biomes yielded sufficient dna for metabarcoding but not 
for metagenomics sequencing thus these samples were used for global mapping 
of taxonomic diversity but excluded from all comparisons between functional 
and taxonomic diversity one sample s contained no s sequences thus 
altogether and samples were used for metagenomics and metabarcoding 
analyses respectively 

to determine the functional gene composition of each sample μg total soil 
dna – bp fragments was ligated to illumina adaptors using the truseq 
nano dna ht library prep kit illumina and shotgun sequenced in three 
runs of the illumina hiseq platform × bp paired end chemistry 
rapid run mode in the estonian genomics center tartu estonia taxonomic 
composition was estimated from the same dna samples using ribosomal dna 
metabarcoding for bacteria s v subregion and eukaryotes s v subregion 
for amplification of prokaryotes and eukaryotes universal prokaryote primers 
 f and rb although this pair may discriminate against certain groups of 
archaea and bacteria such as crenarchaeota thaumarchaeota and sar and 
eukaryote primers f and r were used although the resolution of s 
rrna sequencing is limited to assignments to the level of genus and higher it is 
currently a standard approach in profiling bacterial communities and thus enabled 
us at least to explore patterns at coarse phylogenetic resolution 

each primer was tagged with a – base identifier barcode dna samples 
were amplified using the following pcr conditions °c for min and then 
cycles of °c for s °c for  s and °c for min with a final extension 
step at °c for min the μl pcr mix consisted of μl sterilized h o μl 
 × hot firepol blend mastermix solis biodyne tartu estonia μl each 
primer  nm and μl template dna pcr products from three technical rep 
licates were pooled and their relative quantity was evaluated after electrophoresis 
on an agarose gel dna samples producing no visible band or an overly strong band 
were amplified using or cycles respectively the amplicons were purified 
 favourprep gel pcr purification kit favourgen checked for quality nd 
spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies and quantified qubit dsdna hs 
assay kit life technologies quality and concentration of s amplicon pools 
were verified using bioanalyzer hs dna analysis kit agilent and qubit 
fluorometer with dsdna hs assay kit thermo fisher scientific respectively 
sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq at the embl genecore facility 
 heidelberg germany using a v cycle kit adjusting the read length to 
and bp for read and read respectively s amplicon pools were quality 
checked using bioanalyzer hs dna analysis kit agilent quantified using 
qubit fluorometer with dsdna hs assay kit thermo fisher scientific and 
sequenced on an illumina hiseq at estonian genomics center tartu estonia 
sequences resulting from potential contamination and tag switching were 
identified and discarded on the basis of two negative and positive control samples 
per sequencing run 
soil chemical analysis and biomass analysis all topsoil samples were subjected 
to chemical analysis of phkcl ptotal total phosphorus k ca and mg the content 
of c c n and n was determined using an elemental analyser eurovector 
coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer 

to calculate the absolute abundance of bacteria and fungi using an independent 
approach bacterial and fungal biomass were estimated from plfas in nmol g− 
as follows lipids were extracted from g freeze dried soil in a one phase solution 
of chloroform methanol and citrate buffer chloroform and citrate buffer was 
added to split the collected extract into one lipophilic phase and one hydrophilic 
phase the lipid phase was collected and applied on a pre packed silica column 
the lipids were separated into neutral lipids intermediate lipids and polar lipids 
 containing the phospholipids by subsequent elution with chloroform acetone 

and methanol the neutral and phospholipids were dried using a speed vac methyl 
nonadecanoic acid me was added as an internal standard the lipids were 
subjected to a mild alkaline methanolysis in which fatty acids were derivatized to 
fatty acid methyl esters fames the fames from neutral nlfas and phos 
pholipids plfas were dried using speed vac and then dissolved in hexane before 
analysis on a gas chromatograph as described fungal biomass was estimated as 
the concentration of plfa ω and bacterial biomass from the sum of nine 
plfas i i i a a cy cy me and me 
the nomenclature of fatty acids was according to previously published work 
acquisition of metadata from public databases climate data including monthly 
temperature and precipitation were obtained from the worldclim database http 
www worldclim org in addition estimates of soil carbon moisture ph potential 
evapotranspiration pet and net primary productivity npp at arc minute 
resolution were obtained from the atlas of the biosphere https nelson wisc edu 
sage data and models atlas maps php samples were categorized into biomes 
with all grassland biomes being categorized as ‘grasslands’ thus the following 
biomes were considered and summarized to three global levels moist tropical 
forests tropical montane forests and dry tropical forests savannahs as tropical 
mediterranean grasslands and shrublands southern temperate forests conifer 
ous temperate forests and deciduous temperate forests as temperate and boreal 
forests and arctic tundra as boreal–arctic the time from the last fire disturbance 
was estimated on the basis of enquiries to local authorities or collaborators and 
evidence from the field 
metagenomics and metabarcoding analyses processing of metagenomics sequence 
data most soil microorganisms are uncultured making their identification 
difficult metagenomics analysis has emerged as a way around this to capture both 
genetic and phylogenetic diversity as such it can only directly reveal the poten 
tial for functions through determining and tracing gene family abundances as 
opposed to realized protein activity which may be involved in various functional 
pathways but we can safely assume a strong correspondence between gene func 
tional potential and the resulting ecosystem functioning or enzyme activities 

reads obtained from the shotgun metagenome sequencing of topsoil samples 
were quality filtered if the estimated accumulated error exceeded with a prob 
ability of ≥ or ambiguous position reads were trimmed if base quality 
dropped below in a window of bases at the ′ end or if the accumulated error 
exceeded using the sdm read filtering software after this all reads shorter 
than of the maximum expected read length bp unless noted otherwise 
for external datasets were removed this resulted in retention of out 
of reads in total supplementary table  we implemented a direct 
mapping approach to estimate the functional gene composition of each sample 
first the quality filtered read pairs were merged using flash the merged 
and unmerged reads were then mapped against functional reference sequence 
databases see below using diamond v in blastx mode using ‘ k e 
 e sensitive’ options the mapping scores of two unmerged query reads that 
mapped to the same target were combined to avoid double counting in this case 
the hit scores were combined by selecting the lower of the two e values and the 
sum of the bit scores from the two hits the best hit for a given query was based 
on the highest bit score longest alignment length and highest percentage identity 
to the subject sequence finally aligned reads were filtered to those that had an 
alignment percentage identity and e × − see ‘parameterization and 
validation of metagenomics approach’ for parameter choice 

the functional databases to which metagenomic reads were mapped included 
gene categories related to ros sources peroxidases genes databases kegg 
 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes and cazyme genes http www 
cazy org accessed november to facilitate the interpretation of the 
results the relative abundance of cazyme genes were summed on the basis of 
the substrates for each gene family substrate utilization information for cazyme 
families was obtained from previously published work as well as the cazypedia

did on the basis of the kegg orthologue abundance matrices we cal 
culated seed functional module abundances for functional annotations of 
metagenomic reads we used in silico annotation on the basis of a curated database 
of the orthologous gene family resource eggnog 

for all databases that included taxonomic information eggnog kegg 
cazy reads were mapped competitively against all kingdoms and assigned into 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic groups on the basis of best bit score in the alignment 
and the taxonomic annotation provided within the database at kingdom level all 
functional abundance matrices were normalized to the total number of reads used 
for mapping in the statistical analysis unless mentioned otherwise for example 
rarefied in the case of diversity analysis see ‘statistical analyses’ this normali 
zation better takes into account differences in library size as it has the advantage 
of including the fraction of unmapped that is functionally unclassified reads

normalization such analyses cannot be performed it is currently difficult to test the 
absolute numbers owing to limitations of reliably quantifying soil dna resulting 
from differences in extraction efficiency and the level of degradation 

to identify args in our metagenome samples the merged and unmerged reads 
were mapped to a homology expansion of the antibiotic resistance gene data 
base ardb only hits that passed the minimum sequence identity values as listed 
in the ardb for each family were taken further into account although newer arg 
databases exist only the ardb presently has curated family inclusion thresholds 
that directly allow application to our topsoil dataset as soil microbial diversity 
is so large unlike for gut datasets high fidelity gene catalogue construction will 
not be possible until many more samples are available therefore direct mapping 
of reads to the gene family databases becomes necessary for our analysis in turn 
necessitating arg inclusion thresholds that are well defined for single reads not 
merely for full length genes thus the cut offs curated by resfams or card 
for example are inappropriate as they are defined in the length dependent bit 
score space the ardb cut offs however are defined as sequence identities and 
thus in principle are applicable to sequences shorter than full length because of 
these technical limitations we used a soil gene catalogue to determine card 
based arg abundance matrices see ‘gene catalogue construction’ 

it is important to note that measurements of functional genes including args 
represent relative proportions of different gene families because the absolute 
amount of dna differs among samples this necessitates the use of statistical 
tests that do not assume absolute measurements and centres analysis of this type 
on comparisons across the set of samples 
estimation of taxa abundance using mitag we used a mitag approach to deter 
mine bacterial and fungal community composition from metagenome sequence 
data first sortmerna was used to extract and blast search rrna genes against 
the silva lsu ssu database reads approximately matching these databases with 
e − were further filtered with custom perl and c scripts using flash to 
attempt to merge all matched read pairs in case read pairs could not be merged 
which happens when the overlap between read pairs is too small the reads were 
interleaved such that the second read pair was reverse complemented and then 
sequentially added to the first read to fine match candidate interleaved or merged 
reads to the silva lsu ssu databases lambda was used using the lowest com 
mon ancestor lca algorithm adapted from lotus v we determined 
the identity of filtered reads on the basis of lambda hits this included a filtering 
step in which queries were only assigned to phyla and classes if they had at least 
 and similarity to the best database hit respectively the taxon by sample 
matrices were normalized to the total number of reads per sample to minimize 
the effects of uneven sequencing depth the average of ssu and lsu matrices was 
used for calculating the relative abundance of phyla or classes the abundance of 
mitag sequences matching bacteria and fungi was used to determine the bacterial 
fungal abundance ratio although lsu ssu assessments refer to the number of 
fungal cells rather than the number of discrete multicellular fungi as this can apply 
to all samples equally it is not systematically biased for comparing the trends of 
bacterial to fungal abundance across samples 
external metagenomic datasets to validate and compare the global trends at 
smaller scales we used a regional scale dataset of topsoil samples that was 
generated and processed using the same protocol as our global dataset 
 supplementary table  

in addition to compare patterns of arg diversity in soils and oceans on a global 
scale we re analysed the metagenomics datasets of the tara oceans including all 
size fractions supplementary table  after quality filtering out 
of reads were retained from the tara oceans dataset 

the quality filtered reads from all datasets were mapped to the corresponding 
databases using diamond with the exception that no merging of read pairs was 
attempted because the chances of finding overlapping reads were too low with 
a read length of bp and insert size of bp tara oceans sequences for 
ssu lsu mitags were extracted from these metagenomics datasets as described 
above arg abundance matrices were also obtained from the tara oceans project 
on the basis of the published gene catalogues annotated using a similar approach 
as in the current study 
gene catalogue construction to create a gene catalogue we first searched for com 
plete reference genes that matched to read pairs in our collection using bowtie 
with the options ‘ no unal end to end’ the resulting bam files were sorted 
and indexed using samtools and the jgi summarize bam contig depths 
provided with metabat was used to create a depth profile of genes from the 
reference databases that were covered with ≥ nucleotide identity this cut off 
is commonly used in constructing gene catalogues and chosen to delineate 
genes belonging to the same species using the coverage information we extracted 
all genes that had at least  bp with ≥ × coverage by reads from our topsoil 
metagenomes the reference databases included an ocean microbial gene 
catalogue a gut microbial gene catalogue as well as all genes extracted from 
 published bacterial genomes altogether and genes 

from progenomes igc and tara database respectively could be matched to soil 
reads and were used in the gene catalogue 

the majority of genes in our catalogue were assembled from the topsoil 
samples presented here to reduce the likelihood of chimaeric reads each sample 
was assembled separately using spades development version obtained from 
the authors in metagenomic mode with the parameters ‘ only assembler m 
 meta k ’ only sdm filtered paired reads were used in the 
assembly with the same read filtering parameters as described above resulting 
assemblies had an average n of bases total of all assemblies mb the 
low n reflects difficulties in the assembly of soil metagenomes which probably 
reflects the vast microbial genetic diversity of these ecosystems we further de novo 
assembled reads from two other deep sequencing soil and sediment studies 
using the same procedure and parameters except that the spades parameter 
‘ k ’ was adjusted to a shorter read length furthermore we included 
publicly available data from the european nucleotide archive ena the ena 
was queried to identify all projects with publicly available metagenomes and whose 
metadata contained the keyword ‘soil’ the initial set of hits was then manually 
curated to select relevant project and or samples that were assembled as described 
above additionally we integrated gene predictions from soil metagenomes down 
loaded from mg rast supplementary table  assembly was not attempted 
for these samples owing to the absence of paired end reads and relatively low read 
depth rather only long reads or assemblies directly uploaded to mg rast with 
≥  bp length were retained therefore only scaffolds and long reads with at least 
 bp length were used for analysis on these filtered sequences genes were de 
novo predicted using prodigal in metagenomic mode finally we merged 
the predicted genes from assemblies long reads gene catalogues and references 
genomes to construct a comprehensive soil gene catalogue 

thus reads were processed of which 
passed our stringent quality control the initial gene set predicted on the soil 
assemblies and long reads was separated into complete genes and 
 incomplete genes a non redundant gene catalogue was built by 
comparing all genes to each other this operation was performed initially in amino 
acid space using diamond subsequently any reported hits were checked in 
nucleotide space any gene that covered at least of another one with at least 
 identity over the covered area was considered to be a potential representative 
of it genes are also potential representatives of themselves the final set was chosen 
by greedily picking the genes that were representative of the highest number of 
input genes until all genes in the original input have at least one representative in the 
output this resulted in a gene catalogue with a total of non redundant 
genes at nucleotide identity cut off we mapped reads from our experiment 
onto the gene catalogue with bwa requiring nt overlap and identity 
the average mapping rate was ± although the gene catalogue is an 
invaluable resource for future explorations of the soil microbiome we decided 
to rely on using the direct mapping approach to gene functional composition 
owing to the low overall mapping rate furthermore using minimap to find 
genes at similarity threshold we compared the soil gene catalogue with the 
tara oceans gene catalogue human gut gene catalogue and the progenomes 
prokaryotic database the gene catalogue nucleotide and amino acid sequences 
and abundance matrix estimates from rtk have been deposited at http vm lux 
embl de hildebra soil gene cat 
estimation of arg abundance using card card abundances in topsoil sam 
ples were estimated by annotating the soil gene catalogue using a diamond 
search of the predicted amino acid sequences against the card database and 
filtering hits to the specified bit score cut offs in the card database on the basis 
of gene abundances in each sample we estimated the abundance of different card 
categories per metagenomic sample despite qualitative similarities in overall 
trends of ardb and card abundance matrices card abundance estimation is 
limited by being based on the gene catalogue only a ± of all metagen 
omic reads could be mapped to the gene catalogue 
processing of metabarcoding sequence data the lotus pipeline was used for bac 
terial s rrna amplicon sequence processing reads were demultiplexed with 
modified quality filtering settings for miseq reads increasing strictness to avoid 
false positive otus these modified options were the requirement of correctly 
detected forward s primer trimming of reads after an accumulated error of and 
rejecting reads below average quality or exceeding an estimated accumulated 
error with a probability of ≥ furthermore we required each unique 
read reads preclustered at identity to be present eight or more times in at 
least one sample four or more times in at least two samples or three or more times 
in at least three samples in total read pairs were quality filtered and 
clustered with uparse at identity chimeric otus were detected and removed 
on the basis of both reference based and de novo chimaera checking algorithms

selected from all read pairs assigned to that otu selecting the read pair with the 
highest overall quality and closest to the otu centroid selected otu seed read 
pairs were merged with flash and a taxonomic identity was assigned to each 
otu by aligning full length sequences with lambda to the silva v database 
and the lotus least common ancestor lca algorithm this was performed using 
the following lotus command line options ‘ p miseq derepmin 
simbasedtaxo refdb slv thr ’ otu abundances per sample were summed 
to class and phylum level per sample according to their taxonomic classification 
to obtain taxa abundance matrices however the choice of clustering method for 
example swarm and identity threshold had little effect on retrieved otu richness 
 comparison with threshold r p − comparison with swarm 
clustering r p − 

for eukaryotic s rrna genes we used the same options in lotus except that 
reads were rejected if they did not occur at least six times each in a minimum of 
two samples or at least four times each in a minimum of three samples this was 
done to account for lower sequencing depth in s rrna compared to s rrna 
dataset furthermore the database to annotate fungal taxonomy was extended to 
include general annotations of silva and information from unicellular eukaryotes 
 pr database of reads passed quality filtering the fungal 
its metabarcoding dataset was downloaded and used in addition to s data 
in specific analyses such as finding fungal otus associated with arg relative 
abundance the resulting taxon abundance matrix was further filtered to remove 
sequences of chloroplast origin for all three metabarcoding experiments 

full length sequences representing otus were aligned using the silva refer 
ence alignment as a template in mothur a phylogenetic tree was constructed 
using fasttree with the maximum likelihood method using default settings 
this program uses the jukes–cantor models to correct for multiple substitutions 
parameterization and validation of metagenomics approach although we used 
state of art molecular approaches there are several potential limitations regarding 
our analyses related to the technologies used all metagenomics and amplicon 
based analyses are affected by taxonomic biases in sequence databases whereas 
 pcr free mitag as well as amplicon sequencing are biased owing to differential 
ribosomal gene copy number across taxonomic groups amplicon based metabar 
coding specifically is affected by both primer pcr artefacts and pcr biases that 
may affect estimates of absolute organism abundance these biases are inherent 
to all metagenomics and metabarcoding studies however all these biases affect 
different samples equally same rrna gene copy numbers same pcr biases per 
species same database bias per taxa and thus we estimate that our results are 
robust to these methodological shortcomings shotgun based metagenomics 
is affected by reference bias in which human pathogens or proteobacteria are 
overrepresented the necessity for lenient thresholds becomes obvious from 
annotating phylogenetic profiles with metaphlan using standard parameters 
whereas we observed that most fungal phyla are present abundantly in our samples 
metaphlan detected ascomycota in only out of samples in out of 
samples no organism bacteria archaea eukaryotes was detected and the most 
abundant phylum was proteobacteria as these results are clearly deviating 
from our mitag s s and its analyses specific database cut off thresholds 
were required for this project 

to optimize the analysis pipeline and identify suitable e values for filtering blastx 
results we used metagenomic simulations of four reference genomes for which 
cazy assignments in the cazy database were available simulated reads were 
created as bp paired reads with bp insert at differing sequence abun 
dances from the four reference genomes in each simulated metagenome using 
imessi for this simulated dataset we used the pipeline described above to derive 
cazy functional profiles we found that querying short reads processed as above 
against databases results in the retrieval of most genes at relative abundances 
consistent with expectations on the basis of the reference genomes at e − 
 r ± p furthermore we simulated metagenomes from 
 bacterial genomes five bacterial plasmids one fungal mitochondrion and two 
fungal genomes at differing relative proportions in each of these simulated metage 
nomes supplementary table  we subsequently simulated reads of 
 bp and bp insert size using imessi and mapped these against reference 
databases and retained hits that fulfilled the following arbitrary criteria used in all 
subsequent analyses e value cut off of − alignment length ≥ amino acids 
and similarity ≥ amino acids to the target sequence from these we gener 
ated functional profiles and found a strong correlation of simulated to expected 
functional metagenomic composition on the basis of mixed fungal and bacterial 
genomes r ± p 
estimating fungal antibiotics production we also specifically screened for fungal 
gene clusters directly associated with antibiotic activity on the basis of a 
compiled database of mibig minimum information about a biosynthetic gene 
cluster https mibig secondarymetabolites org repository entries that describe 
gene clusters for which the products have been shown experimentally to display 
antimicrobial activities supplementary table  to extend the range of genes 

that can be associated with the validated antibiotic producing mibig protein 
domains we downloaded all published non redundant fungal genomes depos 
ited in jgi supplementary table  as well as all non redundant fungal genes 
deposited in ncbi the set of mibig and fungus derived genes was screened 
with custom hidden markov models for domains from secondary metabolite 
production specifically these were dmat amp binding condensation pks ks 
and terpene synthesis domains all identified domains were aligned together 
with the mibig domains using clustal omega and a tree was constructed with 
fasttree phylogenetic trees were rooted to midpoint and automatically scanned 
to identify highly supported clades alrt branch support ≥ in which 
antibiotic producing mibig domains were monophyletically grouped the average 
nucleotide identity within each such group was subsequently used as identity cut 
off in the mapping step all metagenomic reads were mapped with diamond 
in blastx mode to the newly created database using the previously mentioned 
sequence identity cut offs and rejecting domains of reads that were mapping to 
bacterial non supervised orthologous groups 
statistical analyses data normalization and diversity estimates all statistical anal 
yses were performed using specific packages in r v unless otherwise noted 
diversity parameters were estimated from otu and functional gene matrices that 
were rarefied to an equal number per sample to reduce the effect of variation in 
sequencing depth using the function rrarefy in vegan v https cran r project

number of merged and singleton reads the total abundance of args per sample 
was estimated by summing the abundance of all individual args per sample arg 
diversity measures indicate the variety and their proportions produced 

from the rarefied matrices we calculated otu orthologous group and cazyme 
gene richness function specnumber and diversity function diversity on the basis 
of the inverse simpson index the latter measure accounts for both richness and 
evenness and it gives more weight to abundant groups compared to the shannon 
index our results were robust to choice of index and the various diversity indices 
were highly correlated in the present dataset for example bacterial taxonomic 
diversities calculated using inverse simpson versus using shannon diversity were 
highly correlated r p − for a comparison of richness and diversity 
trends see extended data fig   b c as evenness and richness were highly corre 
lated in all datasets we report the results that on the basis of the diversity index 
represent both richness and evenness the rarefaction process was repeated for 
calculating taxonomic and gene functional diversity and richness on the basis of 
the average of rarefied datasets 

phylogenetic diversity was calculated on the basis of faith’s phylogenetic 
diversity pd metric in the picante package  v https cran r project org 
web packages picante index html in addition to assess phylogenetic clustering 
and overdispersion nearest relative index nri and nearest taxon index nti 
were calculated in picante although both measures are closely related nri is more 
sensitive to phylogenetic diversity at deep nodes whereas nti is more sensitive 
to phylogenetic clustering towards tips a null model of shuffling taxon labels 
 times was used to randomize phylogenetic relationships among otus 
correlating environmental parameters to taxa and functions to identify the main 
determinants of taxonomic and gene functional composition or diversity and 
relative abundance of phyla and classes we used a series of statistical tests we 
included all prominent environmental variables that we expected to have a significant 
effect on microbial diversity on the basis of previous studies and which were 
feasible to collect these included soil ph carbon and nutrient levels and factors that 
can affect these such as fire assuming soil as the major resource for microbial nutri 
tion we also included isotope ratios of nitrogen ∂ n and carbon ∂ c as these 
provide principal components for carbon and nitrogen cycling to avoid overfitting 
and to ensure model simplicity we excluded the variables that had no significant effect 
on fungal or bacterial diversity such as altitude age of vegetation plant diversity and 
community the first two principal component analysis axes of plant community 
variation at both genus and family level and basal areas of trees thus for univariate 
regression modelling variables supplementary table  were included 

to understand which factors explain the orthologous group and otu based 
community composition variable selection was performed in the forward sel 
function of packfor v r https r forge r project org r group id 
according to the coefficient of determination threshold r all functional 
and taxonomic compositional matrices were transformed using hellinger trans 
formation before statistical analysis furthermore mantel tests and partial mantel 
tests were used to test the effects of geographical versus environmental distances on 
the compositional similarity of otus and orthologous groups as implemented in 
vegan mantel tests allow testing of the correlation between two distance matrices 
partial mantel tests are similar but also control for variation in a third distance 
matrix in our analysis we controlled for the effect of geographic distance while 
testing the correlation of environmental variation and functional or taxonomic 
composition variation the importance of biome type in explaining functional 
gene and taxonomic composition was tested in permutational multivariate

html package arg composition and taxonomic community matrices mitags 
classes and phyla and its otus were normalized to library size using hellinger 
transformation significance of associations was examined by bootstrap tests of 
subsets of each dataset we subsequently used partial least squares pls analysis 
to predict arg relative abundance on the basis of significantly correlated line 
ages which allows the dimensionality of multivariate data to be reduced into pls 
components optimal numbers of pls components for prediction of the relative 
arg abundance were selected on the basis of leave one out cross validation to 
confirm the results of pls analysis we further used a cross validated lasso model 
to simultaneously perform variable selection and model fitting as implemented in 
glmnet v https cran r project org web packages glmnet index html first 
the lambda shrinkage parameter was determined from a cross validated lasso 
penalized logistic regression classifier using this shrinkage parameter a new 
logistic regression classifier was fit to the data to predict arg relative abundance 

to further test direct and indirect effects of geographic and environmental 
variables on microbial distributions we built sem models in the amos soft 
ware spss by including predictors of the best gls model in a priori models 
all indirect and direct links between variables were established on the basis of 
their pairwise correlations we subsequently removed non significant links and 
variables or created new links between error terms until a significant model fit 
was achieved goodness of fit was assessed on the basis of a χ test to evaluate 

the difference between the observed and estimated by model covariance matrices 
 a non significant value indicates that the model fits the observed data we also 
used rmsea and pclose to assess the discrepancy between the observed data and 
model per degree of freedom which is less sensitive to sample size compared to the 
χ test rmsea and pclose show a good fit observed correlations 
between diversity and environmental values can serve as the first step towards 
understanding the structure and function of global topsoil microbiome however 
they are not proof of causations and mechanism despite the fact that we used sem 
modelling to infer indirect links we cannot preclude the possibility of other biotic 
or soil variables confounded with climate variables that we did not include in our 
models further laboratory experiments may be able to address the causality of 
relationships reported in this study 

differences between univariate variables such as taxonomic and functional 
richness were tested using a non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test with 
benjamini–hochberg multiple testing correction post hoc statistical testing for 
significant differences between all combinations of two groups was conducted only 
for taxa with p in the kruskal–wallis test for this wilcoxon rank sum tests 
were calculated for all possible group combinations and corrected for multiple 
testing using benjamini–hochberg multiple testing correction 

geographic coordinates were plotted on a world map transformed to a winkler 
projection using the maptools package v https cran r project org web 
packages maptools index html 
limitations of statistical modelling on a global scale although we performed 
cross validations to test the accuracy of most of our statistical models predictions 
might be limited by the vast diversity in soil microbiomes for example strong 
local variation in soil ph may lead to deviation from general patterns which is a 
common limitation in environmental sciences given the large spatial scale and 
strong environmental gradient in our sampling design and long term persistence 
of dna in soil seasonal variation in soils is expected to have a minor impact 
 in contrast to the oceans in addition the vast majority of our samples were 
collected during the growing season further reducing possible seasonal biases 
we nevertheless tested the effect of sampling month and seasons and found no 
significant effect of seasonality on diversity indices p we also compared 
the effect of seasons and years in a time series study in two of our sites which 
revealed no seasonal effects on richness and composition unpublished data 
in particular the relationship between bacterial phylogenetic diversity and ph 
are strongly consistent with studies performed at the local to continental scales 
and within a single season which indicates the robustness of our results 
nonetheless validation of the proposed models needs to be performed by other 
researchers with more data or an independent dataset particularly by including 
samples from under sampled regions extended data fig   a and from differ 
ent seasons to account for seasonality under sampled regions in our dataset 
 for example north asia lowered precision of our models for those regions 
unfortunately there are no published global datasets with comparable sampling 
protocols that could be directly compared and used for model validation and we 
encourage future studies that will make this possible

study description this study uses high throughput sequencing methods soil chemistry and biomass analysis to characterize soil microbiomes across 
diverse locations and biomes in relation to environmental variables on a global scale 

research sample we used shotgun sequencing and metabarcoding of global soil samples to investigate microorganisms present in samples based on 
their genetic signature focusing on dominant soil microbial groups such as bacteria and fungi all soil samples used for the main text 
were collected by us all ocean samples are from the tara oceans expedition and available at ebi under the project identifiers 
prjeb and prjeb all public soil samples only mentioned in supplement are publicly available on mg rast or ebi as 
specified in the methods 

sampling strategy we collected composite soil samples from sites worldwide the sampling was conducted broadly across the most influential 
known environmental gradient latitude taking advantage of a global “natural laboratory” to study the impact of climate on diversity 
across vegetation biome and soil types and to enable testing the effects of environmental parameters spatial distance and biotic 
interactions in structuring microbial communities we carefully selected representative sites for different vegetation types 
separated by spatial distances sufficient to minimize spatial autocorrelation and to cover most areas of the globe no formal power 
analysis was undertaken but based on experiences from previous studies of soil and ocean metagenomes the present sample size 
was deemed sufficient 

data collection soil samples were metagenomically sequenced at the estonian genomics center tartu estonia s metagenomics and embl 
genecore facility heidelberg germany s soil physical parameters were measured at the estonian university of life sciences 
 estonia soil pflas were measured at lund university sweden by pål axel olsson and nadejda a soudzilovskaia soil metagenomic 
and metataxonomic reads were demultiplexed if required and quality controlled with sdm part of the lotus and matafiler 
pipeline for detailed description please see methods 

timing and spatial scale samples were collected between main global soil samples and independent soil samples no specific 
month was preselected and collection time depended on the availability of collaborators to collect samples for detailed description 
please see methods 

data exclusions desert and mangrove samples were only used in metabarcoding analysis and were excluded in comparative analysis of functional and 
taxonomic patterns samples from desert n g g s s s s s and s and mangrove n g 
biomes yielded sufficient dna for metabarcoding but not metagenomic sequencing thus these samples were used for examining 
global trends of taxonomic diversity but excluded from all comparisons between functional and taxonomic diversity one sample 
 s contained no s sequences thus altogether and samples were used for metabarcoding and metagenomics 
analyses respectively 

reproducibility we used cross validation where appropriate throughout the manuscript and included additional soil sites after initial analysis to 
support the main theories derived from the initial dataset we could reproduce the main findings on independent datasets i e using 
the independent or the public soil dataset to reproduce main arg trends 

randomization the statistics being mostly correlative no randomization was necessary for these involving group of soil sites these were tested 
with the appropriate statistical tests 

blinding since this is an exploratory study without specified groups being compared but rather a correlative analysis no blinding was possible 
in data collection we used cross validation where appropriate throughout the manuscript and included additional sites after initial 
analysis to support the main theories derived from the initial dataset 

did the study involve field work yes no

field work collection and transport
field conditions field work was carried out in sites that were minimally affected by human disturbance across various biomes and regions of the 

world temperature and rainfall were obtained for the soil samples from the climate database and did not influence sampling 
time nor location for detailed description please see methods
