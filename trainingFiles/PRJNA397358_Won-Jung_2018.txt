the total dinoflagellate cyst community and the cysts of cochlodinium polykrikoides in the surface 
sediments of south sea tongyeong coast south korea were analysed using next generation 
sequencing ngs and morphological approaches dinoflagellate cysts can be highly abundant –
 cysts g− dry weight and have diverse species composition a total of taxa of dinoflagellate 
cysts representing genera species including four unconfirmed species and complex species 
were identified by ngs analysis cysts of scrippsiella spp mostly scrippsiella trochoidea were the most 
dominant and polykrikos schwartzii pentapharsodinium dalei ensiculifera carinata and alexandrium 
catenella tamarense were common thus a combination of ngs and morphological analysis is effective 
for studying the cyst communities present in a given environment although c polykrikoides developed 
massive blooms during – microscopy revealed low density of their cysts whereas no cysts 
were detected by ngs however the vegetative c polykrikoides not appeared during – in 
spite of the observation of c polykrikoides cysts this suggests that the c polykrikoides blooms were 
not due to development of their cysts but to other factors such as currents transporting them to a 
marine environment suitable for their growth 

dinoflagellates are one of the most diverse and abundant groups of marine plankton some dinoflagellates are 
known to cause outbreaks of harmful algal blooms in coastal waters around the world and can be extremely 
toxic leading to significant damage of local aquaculture and wildlife the life stages of dinoflagellates form an 
important component of their ecology and biogeography around of the approximately existing species 
of marine dinoflagellates are known to form resting cysts as part of their life history cysts are typically preserved 
in sediments thereby providing an integrated record over time of the presence of cyst producing dinoflagellates 
functions attributed to cysts include species dispersal survival under unfavourable conditions and bloom ini 
tialization – cyst surveys give information on history of harmful species in a given area thereby providing an 
indication of the potential for future blooms and it may reveal species rarely observed in the plankton owing to 
rare short lived or vegetative stages that are difficult to identify

in south korea cochlodinium polykrikoides has been one of the most frequently occurring harmful red tide 
species responsible for fish kills since in particular the tongyeong coastal area located in the south sea 
of south korea is one of the most severely bloomed areas of c polykrikoides although c polykrikoides blooms 
frequently developed in many coastal countries during the last decade cysts of c polykrikoides are still under 
studied – our previous study reported the cyst morphology of c polykrikoides in the natural surface sediment 
samples but the mechanisms of c polykrikoides bloom formation by germination of cysts are mostly unknown 

advances in dna sequencing technology and bioinformatics have significant potential to strengthen biolog 
ical monitoring in the ocean the challenge of modelling and predicting ecological changes requires the linking 
of taxonomic data to the functional roles of individual microbial groups in biogeochemical cycles in other 
words the challenge is not simply a matter of discovering ‘what is there’ but also ‘why it is there ’ in this context 
a major issue relates to how dinoflagellate cysts are temporally distributed and whether they follow any trends in 
their distribution 

to this end we investigated the diversity and distribution of cysts in dinoflagellate communities and c 
polykrikoides by focusing on s rdna using next generation sequencing ngs tool and morphological obser 
vation in samples harvested from the south sea tongyeong coasts during the red tide and the non red tide 
season in south korea

plot the otus generated by the ngs runs against the number of reads appeared to be nearing the asymptotic 
values the amplicons generated – read counts from the six sequenced samples the average read 
count in were higher than in in addition the number of otus and alpha diversity 
 chao richness shannon diversity and simpson evenness showed a similar trend with changes in read counts 
 table  read counts number of otus and alpha diversity in the mg group in were higher than those in 
the ig and og however the data of showed that the number of otus and alpha diversity of the og were 
higher than in the other groups considering that eukaryotic organisms are present in sediments the main group 
identified in the ngs data cut off of read counts was the stramenopiles alveolata rhizaria sar super 
group with average proportion of and in and respectively fig   other groups such 
as opisthokonta archaeplastida amoebozoa and incertae sedis were minor groups in the sar super group

discussion
recently environmental dna edna has begun to be employed in aquatic environmental research and it is 
also being used to monitor marine biodiversity however we are unaware of any reports that have attempted 
to use edna to monitor dinoflagellate cysts in surface sediments approximately dinoflagellate species pro 
duce resting cysts during their life cycle and these are deposited in the sediments the cyst population can 
serve as inocula for the recurrence of blooms of harmful plankton species the dinoflagellate cysts in samples 
from surface sediments of the tongyeong coast revealed a high abundance and diverse species composition 
 supplementary table s it is well known that dinoflagellate cysts occur at higher concentrations in muddy sed 
iments muddy particles are present in the surface sediments of tongyeong coast geological characteristics 
such as currents along coastlines and also determine the abundance of cysts as showing the characteristics of 
currents along tongyeong coasts the cysts in tongyeong coastal area may be introduced by currents moreover 
tongyeong area is one of the richest ecosystems and highest primary productivities in the korean coast thus 
the abundance of dinoflagellate cysts in tongyeong coastline is favoured by marine characteristics such as the 
effects of sediment type currents and nutrient richness 

small and orthoperidinoid dinoflagellate species were the most common cysts of s trochoidea the most 
predominant cyst and pentapharsodinium dalei in morphological results occurred at average proportions of 
 and respectively supplementary table s these cysts are the most frequently encountered of the 
potentially harmful species in particular s trochoidea is a cosmopolitan dinoflagellate species in coastal waters 
and distributed worldwide late summer–autumn peaks of calcareous cyst production were recorded in the gulf 
of naples and early autumn peaks of s trochoidea were recorded in onagawa bay in japan cysts belonging 
to potentially toxic species of the genus alexandrium which cause paralytic shellfish poisoning were recorded 
in of the sediment samples these taxa are commonly found in coastal zones across the world in the 
study area during – vegetative s trochoidea and a catenella tamarense were frequently observed by 
two samplings per month at a high average abundance of and cells ml− respectively unpublished

with the morphological results however pentapharsodinium spp and some scrppsiella spp showed very high 
genetic similarity many researchers – reported that pentapharsodinium is a sister group or primitive lineage of 
scrippsiella species based on molecular phylogeny of calciodinellaceae in this study ngs analysis detected 
taxa compared to only cysts identified using microscopic observation thus ngs analysis can allow research 
ers to detect higher number of species than microscopic analysis this is because cysts have high morphological 
similarity and therefore are difficult to discriminate 

c polykrikoides causes red tides in tongyeong coast almost every year in particular they developed mas 
sive blooms with density greater than cells ml− in summer of supplementary fig  s in our pre 
vious study one of the several cysts isolated from surface sediments in the same study area germinated into 
c polykrikoides cells which was confirmed via s rdna sequences in the present study the cysts of c 
polykrikoides were detected at ranges between and cysts g− dry weight based on morphological analy 
sis however the cysts could not be detected in the ngs and pcr analyses we could not perform replicate 
ngs analyses because the amount of gdna of dinoflagellate cysts in the surface sediment was small this is a 
weak point in the present study this is very important to obtain accurate result and to evaluate the reproduc 
ibility of ngs for the identification of species in particular rare species such as c polykrikoides park et al 
detected c polykrikoides cysts by quantitative pcr using surface sediments of the same study area but they found 
only five cysts in samples this result is similar to our microscopic findings thus the non detection of c 
polykrikoides in our ngs and conventional pcr analyses could likely be due to the presence of very low amounts 
of c polykrikoides cysts in the surface sediments tang and gobler found resting cysts of c polykrikoides in 
culture if c polykrikoides can cause massive blooms in summer high abundance of cysts can be expected after 
termination of the blooms however relatively low densities of c polykrikoides cysts were detected as compared 
with the massive blooms of the vegetative cells in our preliminary study ngs analysis of the sediments below the 
surface layer revealed a high proportion of c polykrikoides cysts supplementary fig  s however in the 
preliminary study extraction of genomic dna was carried out immediately after sampling without long term 
storage for six months the high proportions of c polykrikoides might be attributed to the presence of submerged 
dead c polykrikoides and dna debris by decomposition of c polykrikoides vegetative cells although cysts might 
have constituted a small portion fig   hattenrath lehmann et al reported that low cyst densities after 
high density blooms may be affected by several physical chemical and biological factors which suggest that a 
small portion of the vegetative population is involved in sexual reproduction moreover the other factors affect 
ing density of cysts include grazing of cysts in sediments bacterial degradation of cysts and or the dispersal 
of cysts vegetative cells out of the bloom region via currents followed by deposition of these cysts elsewhere 

evidently the patterns of abundance of c polykrikoides cysts in the present study cannot represent the 
prior blooming and might not predict future blooms thus how blooms develop in spite of lower density of 
c polykrikoides cysts remains unclear alexandrium fundyense a cyst forming dinoflagellate can produce 
massive blooms from low cyst densities hattenrath lehmann et al suggested that the modest densities 
of cysts are important as ‘seed banks for initiating blooms’ however the present results indicate some distinct 
patterns of c polykrikoides cysts as reported by hattenrath lehmann et al according to the hypothesis of 
hattenrath lehmann et al vegetative cells of c polykrikoides were present during as evident from obser 
vation of the sediments in tongyeong area in however vegetative cells of c polykrikoides were not detected 
during the summers of and supplementary fig  s matsuoka et al and jeong et al emphasised 
that c polykrikoides blooms developed after accumulation of cysts transported from other places in particular 
lee et al and park et al mentioned that the mechanism of bloom initiation of c polykrikoides might be related 
to the transport of cells into the study area via lateral mixing of water of this area with that of offshore currents

containing a high density of c polykrikoides cells thus the presence of c polykrikoides might be determined by 
currents transporting them to a marine environment suitable for their growth 

methods
study area and sample collection the study area is located in tongyeong coastal waters in the southern 
coast of south korea ° ′n and ° ′e this costal water is a eutrophic system that is subjected to strong 
mixing between the surface and bottom layers in addition to supplementation of nutrients by food supply from 
fisheries currents in the studied area are not strong because water depths are generally shallow m and 
many islands are present in order to analyse the distribution and composition of the dinoflagellate cysts mor 
phologically and using ngs technology we sampled the surface sediments from sites during the winter in 
december i e after termination of c polykrikoides bloom and sites during summer in september 
 i e during the blooming period of c polykrikoides using a gravity core sampler diameter cm the top cm 
of the core samples were sliced and preserved immediately in the dark at °c fig

one gram of sample was put into a beaker with pure seawater and processed with an ultrasonic probe for s fol 
lowed by sieving with and μm stainless steel mesh the residues on the μm mesh stainless steel mesh 
were distributed equally in ml aliquots with pure seawater dinoflagellate cysts were observed on a ml 
sub sample of the ml aliquots in sedgwick rafter counting chamber under a light microscope zeiss axio

ten grams of sample was weighed in wet condition and dried in an oven to °c for day to measure the water 
content and cyst concentrations in this study were estimated as the sum of living and empty cysts which were 
presented as the number of cysts per gram of dry sediment
