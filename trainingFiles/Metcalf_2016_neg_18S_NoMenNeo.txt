vertebrate corpse decomposition provides an important stage in nutrient cycling in most
terrestrial habitats yet microbially mediated processes are poorly understood here we
combine deep microbial community characterization community level metabolic
reconstruction and soil biogeochemical assessment to understand the principles governing
microbial community assembly during decomposition of mouse and human corpses on
different soil substrates we find a suite of bacterial and fungal groups that contribute to
nitrogen cycling and a reproducible network of decomposers that emerge on predictable time
scales our results show that this decomposer community is derived primarily from bulk soil 
but key decomposers are ubiquitous in low abundance soil type was not a dominant factor
driving community development and the process of decomposition is sufficiently reproducible
to offer new opportunities for forensic investigations 

t
he process of decay and decomposition in
mammalian and other vertebrate taxa is a
key step in biological nutrient cycling with 
out the action of vertebrate and invertebrate
scavengers bacteria archaea fungi and pro 

tists chemical decomposition of animal waste
would proceed extremely slowly and lead to res 
ervoirs of biochemical waste the coevolution
of microbial decomposers with the availability of
vertebrate corpses over the past million years
is expected to result in conservation of key bio 

chemicalmetabolic pathways and cross kingdom
ecological interactions for efficient recycling of
nutrient reserves although mammalian corpses
likely represent a relatively small component of
the detritus pool in most ecosystems their
role in nutrient cycling and community dynam 
ics may be disproportionately large relative to
input size owing to the high nutrient content of
corpses and their rapid rates of decom 
position e g up to three orders of magnitude
faster than plant litter these qualities make
corpses a distinct and potentially critical driver
of terrestrial function 
when a mammalian body is decomposing 

microbial and biochemical activity results in a
series of decomposition stages that are as 
sociated with a reproducible microbial succession
across mice swine and human corpses
 yet the microbial metabolism and succes 
sional ecology underpinning decomposition are
still poorly understood at present we do not
fully comprehend i whether microbial taxa that
drive decomposition are ubiquitous across envi 
ronment season andhost phylogeny ii whether
microbes that drive decomposition derive primar 
ily from the host or from the environment and
 iii whether the metabolic succession of micro 
bial decomposition is conserved across the phys 
icochemical context of decay and host phylogeny 
several questions arise are microbial decom 

poser communities ubiquitous what is the origin
of the microbial decomposer community how
does mammalian decomposition affect the meta 
bolic capacity of microbial communities to an 
swer these questions we used mouse corpses in
laboratory settings and human donors in outdoor
settings see supplementary materials andmeth

our results show that soilmay be themain source

though soil type is not important 
when a mammal dies its immune system no

longer functions and its internal temperatures

for microbial colonization and growth most en 
dogenous mammalian microbes reside in the
gastrointestinal tract and postmortem changes
in the gut microbial community lead to corpse

gate the microbial community dynamics of the

eurotiales and ascomycota are strong drivers of

this suggests that nitrification pulses induced by

microbial function spanning terrestrial ecosys 
tems and though plant inputs are the dominant
source of organicmatter vertebrate corpse inputs
can be important resources for example 
one rain forest in panamawas estimated to receive
 kg in mammal corpses annually per square
kilometer although this represents less than
 of the mass of plant litter received by another
panamanian rain forest corpse nutrient
sources can be an order of magnitude more con 
centrated than plant litter and direct com 
parisons between plant and animal decomposition
resources are rare thus much is still unclear
about the role of corpse inputs in larger scale
biogeochemical cycling e g global carbon and
nitrogen cycling and in supporting specific com 
munities and microbial diversity and our
results provide an importantmicrobial perspective 
a societal impact of these results is the value of

microbial data as physical evidence in medico 
legal death investigation we show that decom 
poser microbial communities could potentially
serve as temporal succession based and spatial
 origin based supplementary text forms of
physical evidence such as the time elapsed since
death pmi and the location of death our obser 
vation that postmortem microbial communities
changed in a clock like manner that provided
an estimate of absolute pmi is similar to using
the development of fly larvae to estimate pmi 
however the fly larvae pmi proxy is limited by
corpse accessibility and season resulting in pmi
estimates in the range of weeks months and
even years taken together our findings dem 
onstrate that postmortem microorganisms can
provide both spatial and temporal insight into
the events surrounding death

the stomach bacterium helicobacter pylori is one of the most prevalent human pathogens 
it has dispersed globally with its human host resulting in a distinct phylogeographic pattern
that can be used to reconstruct both recent and ancient human migrations the extant
european population of h pylori is known to be a hybrid between asian and african bacteria 
but there exist different hypotheses about when and where the hybridization took place 
reflecting the complex demographic history of europeans here we present a year old
h pylori genome from a european copper age glacier mummy the “iceman” h pylori is a
nearly pure representative of the bacterial population of asian origin that existed in europe
before hybridization suggesting that the african population arrived in europe within
the past few thousand years 

t
hehighly recombinant pathogenhelicobacter
pylori has evolved to live in the acidic en 
vironment of the human stomach today 
this gram negative bacterium is found in
approximately half the world’s human pop 

ulation but fewer than of carriers develop
disease that manifests as stomach ulcers or gas 
tric carcinoma predominant intrafamilial
transmission of h pylori and the long term
association with humans has resulted in a phylo 
geographic distribution pattern of h pylori that
is shared with its host this observation
suggests that the pathogen not only accompa 
nied modern humans out of africa but that
it has also been associated with its host for at
least years thus the bacterium has
been used as a marker for tracing complex demo 
graphic events in human prehistory mod 
ernh pylori strains have been assigned to distinct
populations according to their geographic ori 
gin hpeurope hpsahul hpeastasia hpasia 
hpneafrica hpafrica and hpafrica that are
derived from at least six ancestral sources 

the modern h pylori strain found in most eu 
ropeans hpeurope putatively originated from
recombination of the two ancestral populations
ancestral europe and ae and ae it
has been suggested that ae originated in cen 
tral asia where it evolved into hpasia which
is commonly found in south asia on the other
hand ae appears to have evolved in northeast
africaandhybridizedwithae tobecomehpeurope
 however the precise hybridization zone of
the parental populations and the true origin of
hpeurope are controversial early studies observed
a south to north cline in ae ae frequency in
europe this finding has been attributed to
independent peopling events that introduced these
ancestral h pylori components which eventually
recombined in europe since theneolithic period 
more recently it has been suggested that the
ae ae admixture might have occurred in the
middle east orwestern asia between and
 years ago and that recombinant strains
were introduced into europe with the first human
recolonizers after the last glacial maximum
