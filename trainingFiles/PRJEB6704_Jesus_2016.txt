abstract

because soil microbes drive many of the processes underpinning ecosystem services provided by soils under 

standing how cropping systems affect soil microbial communities is important for productive and sustainable
management we characterized and compared soil microbial communities under restored prairie and three

potential cellulosic biomass crops corn switchgrass and mixed prairie grasses in two spatial experimental

designs – side by side plots where plant communities were in their second year since establishment i e inten 
sive sites and regionally distributed fields where plant communities had been in place for at least years i e 
extensive sites we assessed microbial community structure and composition using lipid analysis pyrosequenc 
ing of rrna genes targeting fungi bacteria archaea and lower eukaryotes and targeted metagenomics of nifh
genes for the more recently established intensive sites soil type was more important than plant community in

determining microbial community structure while plant community was the more important driver of soil
microbial communities for the older extensive sites where microbial communities under corn were clearly differ 

entiated from those under switchgrass and restored prairie bacterial and fungal biomasses especially biomass

of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were higher under perennial grasses and restored prairie suggesting a more

active carbon pool and greater microbial processing potential which should be beneficial for plant acquisition

and ecosystem retention of carbon water and nutrients

introduction

to help reduce dependence on fossil fuels there is great

interest in using plant biomass for energy significant

efforts are underway to understand what biomass crops

should be grown where they should be grown and

how they can be managed in sustainable ways kim

et al gao et al werling et al annual

crops such as corn continue to be the most readily abun 

dant and available crops for biofuel production in the

united states us doe while canola and soy 

beans have been used to produce biodiesel iea 

however these crops are monocultures that require

high energy inputs to maintain lose soil and nutrients 

and serve as key food crops for humans and or live 

stock their use for biofuel may increase food costs and

may encourage more land to be converted to agricul 

ture which has negative ramifications for ecosystem

carbon balance wildlife habitat and a host of other

ecosystem services fargione et al 

the disadvantages listed above have encouraged a

focus on perennial grasses such as panicum virgatum

 switchgrass for lignocellulosic ethanol production

 iea switchgrass produces high amounts of bio 

mass and is a native species of north america that

should require less intensive agricultural management

than annual crops wright turhollow biologi 

cally diverse low input systems consisting of mixtures

of native grasses are also candidates for cellulosic

biomass crops because they can be highly productive 

while conserving nutrients jach smith jackson 

can positively affect the diversity of other groups of

organisms werling et al and result in lower

greenhouse gas emissions than annuals and perennial

monocultures tilman et al oates et al 

theoretically more diverse plant communities will

improve sustainability by requiring fewer inputs than

monocultures although support for this hypothesis in

agricultural production settings is scant but see tilman

et al webster et al in more productive

soils it may be more important to have a particular

plant community for example one that includes the

most productive taxa to minimize inputs while

improving stability and resilience adler et al 

all agricultural activity affects biodiversity soil fertil 

ity and water resources groom et al and these

factors should be assessed when evaluating the sustain 

ability of biofuel cropping systems considering the

impacts on microbial soil communities is an important

component of this assessment because most soil based

ecosystems services such as organic matter degradation 

nitrogen fixation nitrification denitrification soil aggre 

gation and water retention are driven by microbial

activity swift et al as has been shown for other

crops the cultivation of biofuel crops can be expected to

influence soil microbial communities thus affecting the

key ecosystem processes and the services they provide

 groom et al liang et al corn is presently

the major crop used for ethanol production in the

united states and soil microbial communities under

corn and prairie have often been contrasted showing

differences in microbial community composition and

improved carbon storage and soil aggregation under

prairie bailey et al allison et al bach et al 

 fierer et al murphy foster the

growing interest in using switchgrass and other grasses

for cellulosic biomass production has sparked similar

investigations contrasting soil microbial communities

under these grasses with those under corn jesus et al 

 mao et al liang et al the ways

and extent to which these crops have been found to

influence soil microbial communities varied according

to the methods used spatial sampling schemes soil and

environmental variables land management and land

history but a general finding has been that cultivation

of perennial grasses stimulates communities more simi 

lar to those under prairies liang et al this is a

desirable outcome because systems with soil microbial

communities similar to those under prairies should

require fewer external inputs and for this reason be

more sustainable but for the most part these studies

have been performed in local settings and the need to

carry out studies at larger geographic scales including

sites with different management types different times

since crop establishment and for a range of soil condi 

tions is necessary to better examine shifts in microbial

communities 

for this reason we used a more holistic approach for

our study our initial hypothesis was that the cultiva 

tion of switchgrass and mixed grasses would lead to

microbial communities more similar to those under

prairie species implying a more sustainable system to

test this hypothesis we sampled over a larger geo 

graphic scale including sites in two states with a range

of soil conditions with different times since crop con 

version and under two different sampling strategies 

we compared microbial communities in soils cultivated

with three potential biofuel crops corn switchgrass 

and mixed grasses and with prairie species and in two

spatial experimental designs one design consisted of

side by side plots where plant communities were in

their second year since establishment i e intensive

sites and the other consisted of regionally distributed

fields where plant communities had been in place for at

least years i e extensive sites we assessed the

microbial communities using three different methods 

lipid analysis pyrosequencing of ribosomal genes that

target fungi bacteria archaea and lower eukaryotes 

and targeted metagenomics of a gene important for a

key ecological function nifh coding for nitrogen reduc 

tase n fixation our main questions were as follows 

 i how do the different biofuel crops affect soil micro 

bial communities that is are soil microbial communities

under switchgrass and mixed grasses more similar to

those under prairie ii how are any effects modified by

location and soil type and iii how do alternative soil

microbial assay methods compare in revealing commu 

nity differences

site description and soil sampling

soil samples were collected from sites in southern michigan

and southern wisconsin under two different designs that have

been used for other studies by the great lakes bioenergy

research center glbrc fig s these two designs are in 

tensive and extensive 

the intensive plots were located at the kellogg biological

station kbs in michigan and at the arlington agricultural

research station aars in wisconsin the plots were arrayed

in randomized complete blocks designs consisting of five repli 

cated m plots of each of four plant communities –

corn switchgrass mixed grasses and restored prairie – and

were harvested annually for biomass we sampled from three

of the five blocks years after their establishment 

the extensive sites were fields located on working farms or

reserves in michigan and wisconsin and were selected from

this increased total biomass under the perennials was

accounted for mainly by the fungi and of the fungi 

mainly by the amf especially in switchgrass there

were no differences in actinomycetes or protozoa lipid

markers among treatments for either state fig d 

the extensive sites exhibited much greater differences

in total biomass between the two states fig a micro 

bial biomass per treatment was higher for the extensive

sites in wisconsin than for those in michigan but mark 

edly so only for the prairie sites it also tended to

increase among treatments from corn to switchgrass to

prairie especially in wisconsin wisconsin extensive

sites exhibited higher microbial biomass per treatment

than corresponding intensive sites especially for the

corn and prairie sites 

for the extensive sites in wisconsin the higher bio 

mass under perennial grasses was due to an increase in

the biomass of both fungi and bacteria and more so to

fungi but for those sites in michigan it was due to

fungi only fig a for both states the gram positive 

gram negative gm gm� ratio was lower fig c 
and the amf sf ratio was greater fig b under the

as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf were identi 

fied by lipids analysis as an abundant group we sought

to identify fungal sequences belonging to this group in

the s rrna gene pyrosequencing data we found that

only of the sequences were classified to glom 

eromycota of these paraglomus sequences were by far

the most abundant in the dataset most of the amf

sequences were recovered from prairie soils which also

presented the highest detected richness with a combi 

nation of at least four genera per site in contrast just

one or two genera could be found in soils cultivated

with switchgrass with a predominance of paraglomus 

the same applies to soils cultivated with corn in wis 

consin no amf sequences were recovered from soils

cultivated with corn in michigan 

 s s rrna gene pyrosequencing

mostly bacterial with only belonging to archaea 

the most abundant bacterial phyla in the libraries were

proteobacteria actinobacteria and acidobacteria at both

intensive and extensive sites fungi metazoa and cer 

cozoa were the more abundant eukaryotic phyla at both

intensive and extensive sites 

no significant differences among locations or treat 

ments were evident at the phylum level although such

differences were observed for otus interpretation was

problematic due to the large number of clusters most

containing few sequences and due to the poor identifi 

cation of representative sequences with many not being

identified past the phylum level 

nifh gene pyrosequencing

we obtained nifh sequences for the samples

assigned to proteobacteria fig s within this phylum 

closest matches to the alphaproteobacteria and betapro 

teobacteria were generally more abundant and gammapro 

teobacteria least abundant variances were large but

there was a tendency for alphaproteobacteria affiliates to

be higher in the extensive sites and betaproteobacteria to

discussion

the three methodological approaches we used to char 

acterize microbial communities provided complimen 

tary insights lipid analysis provided general

taxonomic information coupled to biomass estimates

that gave insight into ecosystem function kirk et al 

 moreover the lipid data proved more sensitive to

cropping system treatments showing the importance of

management on ecosystem processes pyrosequencing

the rrna gene provided in depth taxonomic informa 

tion roesch et al and gene targeted metage 

nomics provided information on a subset of the

community responsible for a certain function iwai

et al in our case we targeted the nifh gene 

which codes for dinitrogenase reductase a component

of nitrogenase the enzyme responsible for n fixation 

n fixing bacteria were chosen as a model to test the

effect of cultivation on an important functional group as

opposed to information provided by taxonomic mark 

ers indeed there is evidence that perennial grasses

with potential for biofuel production such as miscant 

hus may be associated with n fixing bacteria tjep 

kema burris davis et al mao et al 

keymer kent which points to n fixing

microorganisms as an important target group addition 

ally we expected nifh to be less conserved than riboso 

mal genes thus giving us a contrast to the highly

conserved rrna gene 

all three approaches revealed similar differences

among cropping systems in community structure this

agreement between approaches indicates that similar

factors are shaping the structure of bacteria fungi and

n fixing communities under our studied conditions

and that disparate taxa are being affected similarly by

cultivation soil type and land use differences in com 

munity structure could be linked to both treatment and

environmental factors but the relative importance of

the linkages differed between intensive and extensive

sites

under switchgrass and mixed grasses would be more

like those under prairies was confirmed in the older 

extensive sites but not in the young intensive sites in

the second case soil type was a stronger predictor of

community structure and composition here soil type

is confounded with location state meaning that we

cannot separate the effects of soil type from the effects

of geographical distance we assume however that soil

type is the key factor because of the sharp difference in

soil texture and fertility between our intensive sites in

the two states fig s the michigan soils we studied

are sandier and have lower fertility than the wisconsin

soils which are loess derived our results agree with

those of mao et al who also compared microbial

soil communities under biofuel crops by pyrosequenc 

ing s rrna and nifh genes and found that site to site

variation surpassed variation stemming from plant

type 

in contrast communities at the extensive sites tended

to group more strongly by crop indicating that plant

species had a stronger influence on microbial communi 

ties as the plant communities effects on soil microbes

accumulated over time our results were similar to

those of allison et al and mao et al in that

communities under corn were separated from those

under perennial grasses by lipids and s rrna gene

analysis respectively mao et al however were

not able to detect differences in n fixing communities

between crops while we did for the extensive sites 

the differential response to crops observed between

intensive and extensive experiments is likely related to

the length of time the crops had been grown at the sites 

previous experiments by murphy foster and

buckley schmidt demonstrated that despite

changes in plant cover and management soil microbial

communities remained similar even after and years 

respectively in another experiment jangid et al 

found an even longer historical effects lasting through

 years of succession in a previously cultivated field 

at the time of our sampling crops at the intensive sites

had been cultivated for only years which likely was

soil microbial communities of biofuel crops 



not enough time to imprint significant differences on the

structure of the communities in contrast the extensive

sites were much older years allowing time for a
more pronounced differentiation of community struc 

ture according to crop type our findings reinforce the

previous findings of these authors but in the context of

a larger geographical scale and including two different

cultivation settings and a diverse range of soil types 

especially for the extensive sites 

the one exception to this generalization was that

the lipid data did reveal a crop effect on microbial

community structure for the intensive wisconsin sites 

this may have to do with the differences in relative

proportion of amf biomass between treatments for

the two states bacterial and sf biomasses were simi 

lar among treatments for intensive sites in both

states for the richer wisconsin soils however there

was a greater relative difference in amf biomass

between corn and the other crops especially switch 

grass fig b which plots farthest from corn in

fig a herzberger et al also reported total

biomass and especially amf biomass was higher

under restored prairie than corn two years after

establishment at wisconsin intensive sites commu 

nity differences due to amf would not be revealed

by the rrna or nifh data 

as previously observed liang et al when

compared to corn perennial grasses favored the accu 

mulation of microbial biomass as well as an increase in

f b and amf sf ratios in both states indicating that

these grasses favor the accumulation of biomass and

fungi especially amf this was especially true among

the extensive sites in wisconsin which had more time

to become established than the intensive sites and had

higher c fig b and clay table s contents than the

michigan sites soils with higher c and clay contents

are often associated with higher microbial biomass

because there is more c available for microbial growth

 bach et al on the other hand the higher abun 

dance of gram positive bacteria and actinomycetes

under corn indicates a more stressful environment 

because these organisms are known for thriving in

stressful environments and for producing spores yao

et al fierer et al 

the perennial character of switchgrass and prairie

assemblages likely contributes to the accumulation of

fungal biomass especially amf biomass while hyphae

are disrupted by tillage at corn sites tillage breaks the

hyphae of amf and increases the decomposition of

organic matter which might decrease the abundance of

amf and favor saprophytic fungi mycorrhizal fungi

are known to enhance p absorption and utilization so

an increase in amf implies an improvement in the

absorption and utilization efficiency of this nutrient 

additionally recently reported results showed that

mycorrhizae increased the amount of total n in shoots

of switchgrass schroeder moreno et al indicat 

ing that mycorrhizae can also contribute to the

increased utilization of this nutrient the higher fungal

biomass under perennial grasses implies greater poten 

tial for c accumulation under these crops blanco can 

qui because it is assumed that root production is

higher zan et al soil aggregates form more

quickly and to a higher degree jastrow jarchow

 liebman and that fungi produce c compounds

more difficult to degrade allison et al tilman

et al also noted that c sequestration was higher

under native grassland perennials than under corn and

bailey et al observed larger quantities of c and

larger activity ratios in the soil of a restored prairie

compared to a neighboring corn farmland 

fungal species specific to each crop were all sapro 

phytic fungi only a few sequences belonging to amf

were identified but they did reveal some interesting

patterns among these there was a greater abundance

and richness number of otus of amf under prairies

for both states including groups known to have distinct

functional traits such as paraglomerales and diversis 

porales van der heijden scheublin the higher

number of otus observed under prairie may be a con 

sequence of its higher plant diversity because a greater

diversity of plant hosts creates a greater diversity of

niches for amf in addition it is possible that the lower

amf richness under corn stemmed from higher soil dis 

turbance in the cultivation of this crop because there is

evidence that soil disturbance was responsible for

reducing the phylotype richness of amf communities

under seminatural grasslands schnoor et al 

amf was linked previously to higher plant productivity

 maherali klironomos so this greater amf

richness under prairies may positively influence the

productivity of the prairie vegetation it is worth noting

that most of the amf sequences found at our studied

sites and especially those in the prairie soils belonged

to the genus paraglomus previous researchers found

paraglomerales are difficult to detect in roots and soils

and that commonly used primers for amf fail to

amplify paraglomerales sequences lumini et al 

gosling et al thus our data indicate that mid 

western prairies may be good places to study the diver 

sity and ecology of this lesser known amf genus 

there was an inconsistency in the amf prevalence

indicated by the lipid method where amf were of

the fungal biomass and the pyrosequencing methods

where only of the fungal s rrna sequences

were assigned to glomeromycota a similarly low frac 

tion of amf was observed in the s rrna data both

ssu and lsu primers used were perfect matches to

most known strains so mismatch is not a likely expla 

nation although other biases have been observed in

competitive rrna gene amplification one possible

explanation is that the biomass hyphae measured by

lipid may not be filled with protoplasm or with nuclei 

cytoplasmic streaming is known to occur in soil fungi 

often resulting in evacuated hyphae because their proto 

plasm is concentrated at the growing tips klein 

paschke the reason for this large discrepancy is

important to resolve for proper accounting of this

important group of soil fungi 

while we could specifically link ssu rrna gene

sequences to crops and soils and given that these

sequences provide better taxonomical resolution the

detection of large numbers of uncultured organisms

and taxa with no clearly defined roles limited physio 

logical and functional interpretation furthermore the

large number of sequences and otus made it difficult

to detect relevant indicator organisms based on rrna

pyrosequencing data this is a problem common to

many ssu rrna sequencing studies especially for

environmental samples on the other hand sequence

assignment and the identification of indicator organisms

were more informative with the nifh sequences 

although some horizontal gene transfer may cloud pre 

cise taxonomic resolution 

contrary to what we expected the faster evolving

protein coding gene nifh provided no better resolution

than the other methods after conversion of nucleotide

sequences to amino acid sequences which was neces 

sary to correct for sequencing errors as well as to reflect

function the low diversity we found for nifh may be

the result of the primers we used not amplifying all

nifh variants the primers used are reported as being

selective for proteobacteria sequences diallo et al 

however it is worth noting that these authors used a

previous pcr step with different primers which might

have introduced extra bias into their pcr in a more

recent study gaby buckley reported that no

nifh primers were comprehensive for the known nifh

genes and that the primers developed by poly et al 

 do exclude certain groups a trade off exists

soil microbial communities of biofuel crops 



between finding primers and conditions that give the

best coverage for groups important in the habitat and

reliable amplification we decided the poly primers

were the current best choice because amplification with

the broader coverage zehr mcreynolds pri 

mers was troublesome probably because of their high

degeneracy 

we conclude that location a proxy primarily for soil

type but also including site history landscape and

climate was the major factor determining microbial

communities in our year old intensive sites and that

these study sites were not under cultivation long

enough for the crop to impose a strong signature on the

microbial communities the only exception to this was

that the lipid data revealed a crop effect in the richer

wisconsin soil in contrast when the same crop had

been grown on a site for years or longer a crop effect

was observed with communities under corn clearly dif 

ferentiated from those under perennial grasses both

presence of perennial plants and higher plant diversity

likely favored the accumulation of microbial biomass

and fungi especially amf under switchgrass mixed

grasses and prairie leading to a more stable environ 

ment and highlighting that these alternatives to corn for

biofuels may improve soil functional stability and

sustainability
