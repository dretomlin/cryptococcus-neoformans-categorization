abstract
symbioses between eukaryotic algae and nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria have been recognized in recent years as a key source
of new nitrogen in the oceans we investigated the composition of the small photosynthetic eukaryote communities
associated with nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in the brazilian south atlantic bight using a combination of flow cytometry
sorting and high throughput sequencing of two genes the v region of s rrna and nifh two distinct eukaryotic
communities were often encountered one dominated by the mamiellophyceae bathycoccus and ostreococcus and one
dominated by a prymnesiophyte known to live in symbiosis with the ucyn a nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium among
nifh sequences those from ucyn a were most abundant but three other ucyn a clades a a a were also found 
network analysis confirmed the relation between a and a clades and their hypothesized hosts and pointed out to the
potential association between novel clade a with braarudosphaera bigelowii previously hypothesized to host a 

introduction

small photosynthetic eukaryotes are key component of
the biomass and primary production in marine ecosystems
 – in coastal waters these small photosynthetic eukar 
yotes are often dominated by green algae from mamiello 
phyceae whereas in oceanic waters they are much
more diverse including green algae mamiellophyceae 

prasinophytes clade vii but also pelagophytes chryso 
phytes and prymnesiophytes while for some
groups such as mamiellophyceae prasinophytes clade vii 
or pelagophytes numerous representatives have been iso 
lated in culture this is not the case for chrysophytes or
prymnesiophytes initially these small eukaryotes were
thought to be purely phototrophs but recently novel types
of trophic modes and associations have been discovered in
particular quite a few appear to be mixotrophs such as
micromonas in polar regions and a new type of sym 
biosis has been found between a small haptophyte alga and
a nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium ucyn a 

nitrogen n fixation performed by diazotrophs is an
anaerobic process catalyzed by the nitrogenase enzyme 
which produces biologically available ammonium nh 

 
it has a strong impact on primary productivity in past 
present and future oceans trichodesmium sp was
initially identified as the most important marine diazotroph
 however recent discoveries have set the ground
for a paradigm shift in our understanding of n fixing
players regarding their diversity ecological strategies 
geographic distribution and impact on the primary pro 
ductivity in the global ocean – and references
therein two decades ago an uncultivated unicellular
cyanobacterium ucyn a was discovered by pcr

amplification of the nitrogenase gene nifh the gen 
ome of ucyn a was found to be extremely streamlined 
lacking the genes involved in the oxygen evolving pathway 
co fixation and biosynthetic pathways of several
amino acids and purines such modifications in the
genome resembling the ones observed in cellular orga 
nelles led to the hypothesis of a symbiotic partnership 
this was confirmed later by the identification of an asso 
ciation between ucyn a and an apparently non calcifying
prymnesiophyte microalga closely related to the coc 
colithophorid braarudosphaera bigelowii which bears
pentagon shaped coccoliths pentaliths and to the non 
calcifying haptophyte chrysochromulina parkeae 
recent data suggest that this symbiosis could be responsible
for a major part of the oceanic nitrogen fixation 

ucyn a appears to be quite diversified with at least six
clades a to a which forms a monophyletic group with
crocosphaera sp and cyanothece sp – the
hosts of the two major clades a and a appear to have
different cell sizes to harbor a different number of sym 
bionts and present distinct oceanic distributions 
the former being less widespread but with higher relative
abundance peaks than the latter 

many open questions remain concerning these sym 
bioses including the ecological distribution of the hosts and
their importance within the phytoplankton community the
south atlantic bight off brazil is reported to have a high
ucyn a abundance in comparison to other oceanic
regions and also appears to be a hot spot of nitrogen
fixation we investigated pico and nano phytoplankton
composition in this area using flow cytometry sorting 
combined with parallel high throughput sequencing of the
v region of the s rrna and of a nifh gene fragment 
our data revealed two major types of small photosynthetic
eukaryote communities one dominated by green algae and
the other dominated by the ucyn a host by analyzing
the nifh diversity in the same samples we recovered
sequences from ucyn a confirming the importance of
this symbiosis in oceanic regions off brazil 

material and methods

 becton dickinson san jose ca equipped with a laser
emitting at nm and a mm nozzle emitted light was
collected through the following set of filters band
pass bp for side scatter bp for orange fluores 
cence and long pass for red fluorescence signal

tosynthetic pico and nanoeukaryotes populations were
selected based on light scatter orange phycoerythrin and
red chlorophyll fluorescence as described previously

contigs that contained ambiguities n were discarded 
amplicons for s rrna and nifh contigs were extracted
using the command pcr seqs allowing for two mismatches
between the sequence and the primers supplementary
table for each gene sequences were dereplicated and
singletons were removed unique sequences for s rrna
and nifh were aligned respectively to the silva seed
available on mothur website https www mothur org wiki 
silva reference files and the aligned nifh database 
available from http www css cornell edu faculty buckley 
nifh htm aligned unique sequences were pre clustered
allowing for two differences chimeras were removed with
the uchime algorithm as implemented in mothur at this
stage sequences from control samples e g sheath fluid
sort and sequences corresponding to reads were
removed the latter step makes all subsequent steps much
faster to perform while removing a very small number of
reads for example for s rrna it decreases by sixfold the
number of unique sequences while reducing the total
number of reads by only supplementary table 
otus were built at the similarity level using mothur
average neighbor algorithm the otus for s rrna
were taxonomically assigned using the pr database 
version available on figshare repository https figshare 
com articles pr rrna gene database and on
github https github com vaulot pr database releases 
this version of pr incorporates a revision of haptophyta
taxonomy following edvardsen et al s rrna
and nifh otus were also searched against the genbank
database using blast plugin november in gen 
eious® one sample n table was dominated
by metazoa sequences and was not considered further for
 s rrna otus of total reads from opistho 
konta and streptophyta were not further considered six
groups dinophyta ochrophyta haptophyta cryptophyta 
chlorophyta and chlorarachniophyceae were considered
as autotrophic most analyses focus on these autotrophic
groups to the exclusion of non autotrophic groups such as
syndiniales autotrophic s rrna or nifh otus were
considered as “major” supplementary table supple 
mentary table if they contributed to a minimum of 
of reads in at least one sample this definition seems better
than only considering the total contribution of a given
otu because some specific samples may have one domi 
nant otu that is not found in any other sample and which
has therefore a low total abundance over the whole sample
set nifh sequences from major otus were aligned to
related sequences obtained by blast as well as to some
reference sequences using mafft phylogenetic
analysis was performed with fasttree both programs
were used as implemented in geneious with default
parameters

discussion

phytoplankton communities in the euphotic zone of the
brazilian south atlantic bight are influenced by two main
water masses the warm and oligotrophic tropical water
on the top meters and the cold and nutrient rich south
atlantic central water sacw below in this region 
photosynthetic pico and nanoeukaryotes average about
 cells per ml and cells per ml respectively 
to assess the taxonomy of these small eukaryotes we
analyzed populations sorted by flow cytometry based on
their size and pigment fluorescence this method has the
advantage of targeting specific populations and allows to
focus in components of the diversity that usually go
unnoticed from filtered samples due to the competition
with more abundant or more easily amplified targets 
almost all previous studies using this approach relied on
sorting live samples which requires the

availability of a sorting flow cytometer onboard ships and
are therefore complex in terms of logistics a recent study
 used preserved samples but required both sample
concentration and progressive freezing we used instead a
much simpler preservation method relying on the addition
of dmso to ml of non concentrated seawater
samples followed by a quick flash freezing by eliminat 
ing sample filtration the protocol used here requires 
min hands on work after the water samples get onboard 
therefore making sampling considerably easier in oceano 
graphic cruises and minimizing changes in the plankton
community 

despite the small number of cells sorted in some samples
 – we could successfully pcr amplify and
sequence both the s rrna gene and the nifh gene on
these samples the vast majority of eukaryotes sequences
were from autotrophs the major heterotrophic group
was syndiniales which are known to infect dinoflagellates
 these parasites were probably sorted in association
with the dinoflagellates that were present in our samples
 e g otu or otu the successful targeting of the
autotrophic population by flow cytometry sorting is also
demonstrated by the low number of otus for s

fig network analysis of the major autotrophic s rrna circles 
and nifh squares otus see supplementary table and supple 
mentary table using sparcc correlation colors of nodes
correspond to taxonomic assignation size of nodes is proportional to

number of reads obtained width of edges is proportional to correlation
between otus only correlations with pseudo p values 
were considered

rrna using a similarity level which is more than one
order of magnitude less compared to what is found in stu 
dies using filtered material e g likewise the
number of otus for nifh was very low even compared
to typical clone library studies e g demonstrating
that we probably only targeted bacteria that were in asso 
ciation with the sorted eukaryotes 

heatmap and network analysis figs and demon 
strated that for some of the phylogenetic groups s rrna
otus belonging to the same class had a tendency to co 
occur suggesting that population response to environmental
forcing occurred often at the class level this was the case
for mamiellophyceae prymnesiophyceae and chrysophy 
ceae which are well known contributors to phytoplankton
in tropical oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters 

the most prevalent guild characteristic of warm tropical
waters fig was dominated by the prymnesiophyceae
otu which sequence is identical to that of the known host
of ucyn a fig this sequence has been shown to be
abundant in specific oceanic areas in particular off brazil 
where it can exceed of prymnesiophyceae reads 
however in our case it could be much more dominant 
representing up of small photosynthetic eukaryotic reads
 at st m another otu otu matched b bigelowii 
which is hypothesized to be the host of ucyn a and
is more widespread but less abundant than the host of ucyn 
a other relatively abundant genera included the
coccolith bearing algirosphaera syracosphaera and emi 
liania although the latter genus is extremely widespread
 data on the distribution of the two former ones are much
more scarce although they were among the most abundant
otus in a seasonal study of oslo fjord norway 

we observed four types of ucyn a off brazil belonging
to the clades a to a but none were related the two
recently defined clades a and a although for all
samples where ucyn a was present either the ucyn a 
host or braarudosphaera bigelowii were detected these two
otus were relatively abundant in excess of of the
reads in two sample where ucyn a was not observed st
 and st both at m this suggests that ucyn a
symbiosis may not be always obligatory for the host or that 
in these two cases ucyn a cell dislodgement may have
occurred during sampling or sorting as observed previously
 the most prevalent clade was a which is con 
sistent with recent reports of this clade being the most
abundant in metabarcoding surveys e g its co 
occurrence fig with the prymnesiophyte s rrna
otu reinforces the hypothesis of the specificity of this
symbiotic relationship clade a was less frequent and less
abundant but was also clearly linked in our network analysis
to its hypothesized host b bigelowii it co occurred with a 
in a few samples as observed elsewhere in coastal influenced
pelagic waters in contrast to a and a virtually

nothing is known about the other clades off brazil a 
could co occur with a as recently observed network
analysis using major otus suggested that a could be
correlated to bathycoccus and to a dinoflagellate while a 
could be similar to a also hosted by b bigelowii fig 
however as a and a were in relatively low abundance 
they also could occur in symbiosis with a rare autotrophic
eukaryote not taken into account in the network analysis 

we also detected some nifh sequences related to
t erythreum which had been previously observed in
this area these sequences originated from samples
taken within a trichodesmium bloom and at m in the
most offshore station of tr it is surprising that we could
sort trichodesmium cells because they possess phycoery 
thrin and our settings discriminated against phycoerythrin 
containing cells however senescent cells of tricho 
desmium display lower phycoerythrin fluorescence signal
 and could have been sorted along with the eukaryotes 
both trichodesmium and ucyn a co occurred in the
same samples fig confirming that these two nitrogen 
fixing cyanobacteria are not mutually exclusive which has
been observed elsewhere 

the second type of community was dominated by
mamiellophyceae either bathycoccus or ostreococcus or
both fig mamiellophyceae are known to be ubiquitous
in marine ecosystems but more prevalent in coastal waters 
being replaced by prasinophytes clade vii in pelagic
regions b prasinos was first described from a deep
mediterranean sea isolate but since it has been
observed in many areas from coastal waters to the open
ocean the existence of two different species of
bathycoccus has been hypothesized based on metagenomic
data and strains available in cultures unfortunately 
these two species have exactly the same s rrna
sequence and therefore we were not able to differentiate
them in the present study in contrast at least clades can
be distinguished by s rrna for ostreococcus three
corresponding to named species o tauri o “lucimarinus”
and o mediterraneus and the last one clade b also
called oii not yet described the major ostreococcus
otu in our study corresponds to clade b which has been
found in more oligotrophic regions than o “lucimarinus”
 e g for the third major mamiellophyceae genus
micromonas its two main otus were in relatively low
abundance and related to the newly described species 
m commoda clade a and m bravo clade b which are
known to be widespread and abundant in coastal waters
 network analysis demonstrated that these three genera
 ostreococcus bathycoccus and micromonas plus an
otu belonging to another green alga prasinophytes clade
vii a often co occurred in our samples fig 

a recent global study on ucyn a symbioses did
not find a strong correlation between their distribution and

c gérikas ribeiro et al 



temperature n p ratios or chlorophyll a suggesting their
structuring factors may lie elsewhere in the present work 
nmds analysis suggests that the alternation between
communities dominated by ucyn a host and mamiel 
lophyceae fig is linked to water masses with the former
found in low chlorophyll tropical waters and the latter near
the interface between warm tropical waters and colder
south atlantic waters where the chlorophyll maximum
develops two key factors that could explain the dominance
of the ucyn a host community could be higher tem 
peratures and lower n p ratios both favoring nitrogen 
fixing cyanobacteria tropical waters off brazil have a
very low n p ratio down to in the present study which
could explain why this symbiosis is so prevalent another
factor which could be important but was not measured in
our study is iron a key element for nitrogen fixers by
comparison the “green “community was found in samples at
depth with high chlorophyll fluorescence supplementary
figure corresponding to the dcm at the interface
between tropical water and sacw this environment
matches the hypothesized habitat for ostreococcus clade b
 and bathycoccus 

the lack of representative cultures from ucyn a
symbioses limits our comprehension of the factors struc 
turing their populations and their competitive fitness in
relation to other populations our study provides evidences
that small phytoplankton communities in the region are
highly structured and fall into a few specific types it con 
firms the existing links between ucyn a cyanobacteria
bacteria and prymnesiophyceae as well as the ecological
importance of this association in the south atlantic off
brazil moreover our approach allows to formulate
hypothesis about other ucyn a clades for which host have
not been characterized to this date
