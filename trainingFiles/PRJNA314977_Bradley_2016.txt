abstract

the use of high throughput sequencing technologies with the s rrna gene for characterization of bacterial and archaeal com 
munities has become routine however the adoption of sequencing methods for eukaryotes has been slow despite their signifi 
cance to natural and engineered systems there are large variations among the target genes used for amplicon sequencing and
for the s rrna gene there is no consensus on which hypervariable region provides the most suitable representation of diver 
sity additionally it is unclear how much pcr sequencing bias affects the depiction of community structure using current prim 
ers the present study amplified the v and v v regions from seven microalgal mock communities as well as eukaryotic com 
munities from freshwater coastal and wastewater samples to examine the effect of pcr sequencing bias on community
structure and membership we found that degeneracies on the end of the current v specific primers impact read length and
mean relative abundance furthermore the pcr sequencing error is markedly higher for gc rich members than for communi 
ties with balanced gc content importantly the v region failed to reliably capture of the mock community members and
the v v hypervariable region more accurately represents mean relative abundance and alpha and beta diversity overall the
v and v v regions show similar community representations over freshwater coastal and wastewater environments but spe 
cific samples show markedly different communities these results indicate that multiple primer sets may be advantageous for
gaining a more complete understanding of community structure and highlight the importance of including mock communities
composed of species of interest 

importance

the quantification of error associated with community representation by amplicon sequencing is a critical challenge that is often
ignored when target genes are amplified using currently available primers differential amplification efficiencies result in inac 
curate estimates of community structure the extent to which amplification bias affects community representation and the accu 
racy with which different gene targets represent community structure are not known as a result there is no consensus on which
region provides the most suitable representation of diversity for eukaryotes this study determined the accuracy with which
commonly used s rrna gene primer sets represent community structure and identified particular biases related to pcr am 
plification and illumina miseq sequencing in order to more accurately study eukaryotic microbial communities 

the use of high throughput sequencing technologies hastransformed the field of microbial ecology by contributing to a
significant body of work that has changed our understanding of
microbially diverse populations in a range of ecosystems this is
particularly true for investigations of bacterial and archaeal com 
munities that target the s rrna gene – however ampli 
con sequencing approaches for eukaryotes have lagged behind 
due in part to the large variation in copy numbers of target genes
among species to � for the s rrna gene and
multiple hypervariable regions that are typically longer than early
dna sequencing platforms could sequence the use of ampli 
con sequencing is of particular interest with respect to eukaryotic
microalgae or phytoplankton due to their role in natural and en 
gineered ecosystems e g contribution to global carbon fixation
 eutrophication of waterways treatment of nutrients
and heavy metals in wastewater and the production of bio 
fuels among others 

in engineered systems microalgal technologies are uniquely
positioned to provide solutions for both wastewater and energy
industries by recovering nutrients i e nitrogen n and phos 

phorus p via assimilation and generating carbon rich algal
feedstock for downstream processing indeed there is a growing
consensus in the algal biofuel industry that wastewater should be
leveraged to make algal biofuels environmentally and economi 
cally viable – elucidating the relationship between system
function i e nutrient and carbon assimilation operating pa

examination of microalgal community structure i e member 
ship and relative abundance and dynamics the molecular tools
for which are currently underdeveloped 

although the wastewater field has used s rrna amplicon
sequencing to evaluate a wide range of bacterial communities
 e g references to the use of high throughput sequencing
technologies with eukaryotic microalgae is virtually nonexistent 
and the field relies heavily on microscopy for species identifica 
tion sequencing offers the rapid detection of algal species without
many of the problems associated with microscopy i identifica 
tion is not limited to those organisms with well identified mor 
phological markers ii fewer personnel and less time are required
 and iii hundreds of samples can be processed simultane 
ously by leveraging massively parallel approaches afforded by
high throughput sequencing furthermore examining the com 
munity using amplicon sequencing allows us to take an in depth
look at the community structure of the organisms present when
coupled with other techniques such as transcriptional analysis of
a particular functional gene and or statistical approaches to cor 
relate reactor performance with the algal community high 
throughput sequencing may allow us to relate community struc 
ture to community function 

despite recent studies that have developed broad eukaryotic
primers using the small subunit ssu s rrna gene 
there is no widely accepted target gene used to sequence microal 
gae previous studies have targeted various regions of the rrn
operon e g s plus internal transcribed spacer its 
 s – and s regions mitochondrial genes
 e g cytochrome c oxidase coi and chloroplast genes
 e g the rbcl gene which encodes the large subunit for ribulose 
 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco – and
the s rrna gene but these studies have been predomi 
nately limited to marine phytoplankton e g references 
 and occasionally focused on freshwater phytoplankton e g 
reference the s rrna gene is commonly amplified and
offers the advantage of numerous alternating hypervariable v to
v and conserved regions within the s rrna gene multiple
studies have used different variable regions for amplification in 
cluding the v v v v – and v 
regions with the v and v regions often being used together
 e g references and a number of recent studies have com 
pared variable regions along the entire s rrna gene for all eu 
karyotes and eukaryotic plankton and highlighted
conserved regions that may be best suited for amplifying hyper 
variable regions these studies identified primer combinations us 
ing in silico sequence database coverage and taxonomic resolution
and confirmed their feasibility with environmental surveys how 
ever many of the regions identified by these studies are too long
 � nucleotides nt to allow for overlaps between the forward
and reverse reads using the illumina miseq platform to
 nt single read length resulting in � to nt long com 
bined reads with to bp overlap 

additionally a critical challenge that must be addressed is the
quantification of errors associated with gene based amplification
 i e pcr bias of these primer sets there are several well docu 
mented problems associated with the amplicon sequencing ap 
proach i sequencing errors and chimeras may be formed during
dna amplification ii primer coverage may not capture the
desired microbially diverse populations iii differential am 
plification efficiencies among the target gene may skew opera 

tional taxonomic unit otu relative abundance and iv 
gene copy number variation may affect interpretations based on
otu relative abundance – the first issue has been the tar 
get of much research particularly with respect to s rrna gene
sequencing e g references to while previous research ex 
amining the coverage of s rrna hypervariable regions e g 
references and provides insight into the second al 
though pcr bias has been studied using s rrna genes e g 
references and the effect that it has on interpreting com 
munity structure has not been robustly addressed for the s
rrna gene 

this study seeks to address the effect of primer selection and
resultant pcr sequencing bias on the evaluation of eukaryotic
microalgae i e microalgae or phytoplankton using s rrna
gene sequencing in addition to identifying bias we offer a rede 
signed primer set that solves problems associated with commonly
used primers and more accurately represents microalgal commu 
nities in terms of coverage and relative abundance specifically 
pcr sequencing bias was examined by the following i sequenc 
ing seven microalgal mock communities with different relative
abundance constructs using s rrna primers targeting the v 
and v v hypervariable regions ii examining the variations in
the detected community structure compared to the theoretical
community structure by each primer set iii quantifying the er 
ror in otu mean relative abundance and its effect on alpha and
beta diversity measurements iv correlating the error in mean
relative abundance to specific biases related to the pcr amplifica 
tion process and v testing improved primers on environmental
samples for validation in particular we find that a commonly
used v primer has critical shortcomings when applied to our
mock community due to nucleotide mismatches on the end 
the redesigned primer more accurately captures community
structure and represents freshwater species with high accuracy 
while the v v region offers good representation of all freshwa 
ter and marine species tested in this study 

materials and methods
primer design and evaluation primers were chosen by first examining
the s rrna gene through in silico testing database sequences for all
eukaryotes were obtained from the silva database v www arb silva
 de curated by mothur and trimmed to the s cerevisiae reference
sequence accession number z using pcr seqs in mothur v 
 shannon entropy was calculated according to the alignment position
for all sequences using the method of shannon and the equation
e � � �p�xj� log �p�xj�� for each of the nucleotides present at a given
location where p xj was the frequency of the nucleotide xj at that align 
ment position j following shannon entropy calculations conserved
regions with alignment positions containing less than entropy were
identified fig a 

conserved regions were targeted as possible primer locations 
 and combinations of conserved variable regions i e possible ampli 
cons were plotted against shannon entropy fig b in order to deter 
mine areas that had the highest entropy and amplicon length suitable for
sequencing on the illumina miseq platform conserved regions were then
checked against general eukaryotic primers from the literature table 
and examined for their suitability in amplifying the s rrna gene pri 
ority was given to regions with high entropy and lengths compatible with
current illumina miseq sequencing to bp to allow for maximal
read overlap and a primer set was selected from each v and v v 
region using established primers from the literature references and
 respectively that have been used for numerous studies 
although the v region average bp has typically been sequenced

capabilities that were not achievable with early high throughput sequenc 
ing approaches selected primers were evaluated for general eu 
karyote and alga specific coverage using the silva testprime tool 
 see fig s in the supplemental material 

full length primers containing the adapters for illumina miseq se 
quencing were constructed according to the dual index method of kozich
et al briefly each forward and reverse primer consists of a to
 nucleotide long illumina miseq adapter to attach the dna sequence
to the miseq flow cell the adapter is followed by an nucleotide index 
ing sequence a pad linker sequence of nucleotides to increase the over 
all melting temperature and the s rrna gene specific primer the
presence of an indexing sequence on both the forward and reverse primers
allows the multiplexed sequencing of a large number of samples with
relatively few primers compared to traditional single indexing methods
that contain only one index on the forward or reverse primer based on
the initial sequencing results see fig s and s in the supplemental ma 
terial heterogeneity spacers ranging from to nucleotides were in 
serted between the indexing sequence and pad linker region to phase the
sequencing of conserved regions between samples and maximize “se 
quencing entropy” per cycle similar to the method of fadrosh et al 
this phasing approach allows better cluster delineation during the illu 
mina sequencing process which may be particularly critical for low di 
versity samples figure shows the entropy per alignment position of

results and discussion
failed sequencing runs despite the fact that the v primer set
selected has been adapted to both the roche and the
illumina miseq systems an initial sequencing run illumina
miseq � paired end reads using the v primer set which
primes the reverse read and the indexing barcode associated with
it for sequence identification was unsuccessful due to a failure of
the read and index primers consisting of pad linker plus v 
reverse primer the read index primer was stripped off during
the miseq’s cycle chemistry because of a lower melting tempera 
ture to °c than the temperature at which nucleotides
are incorporated during illumina miseq sequencing °c this
resulted in no sequencing of the reverse strand or the reverse index
 see fig s in the supplemental material although forward reads
were obtained they could not be assigned to samples because of
the dual indexing approach used 

runs and utilized read index primers incorporating lna
to increase the primer melting temperature to °c the second
sequencing run experienced two additional problems with the v 
primer set low quality reads resulting from poor cluster delinea 
tion caused by low diversity environmental samples and signifi 
cant loss of microalgal coverage due to nucleotide mismatches on
the end of the reverse primer microalgal organisms particu 
larly those present in wastewater treatment are under highly se 
lective pressures and consequently are often dominated by a few
select organisms environmental samples selected for se 
quencing had highly similar nucleotide patterns especially during

diversity of nucleotides during the first cycles is known to cause
quality issues in the miseq because it uses these cycles to identify
clusters and perform matrix calculations the addition of
phix to a sequencing run provides a control and generally im 
proves nucleotide diversity however the reverse read during se 
quencing run still showed poor quality despite the addition of
phix see fig s a a number of studies e g references 
and have proposed the use of variable length nucleotide spac 
ers to improve overall entropy and read quality of the sequencing
library an approach similar to that of fadrosh et al whereby
nucleotide spacers of different lengths were added to the indexing
barcode was used for run and significantly improved the read
quality of this sequencing run 

additionally the v primer set substantially altered the abun 
dance representation of mock community members some spe 
cies such as rhodomonas sp were overrepresented by approxi 
mately to times while others were underrepresented by as
much as orders of magnitude see fig s in the supplemental
material two of the members prymnesium parvum and iso 
chrysis galbana were not detected at all these errors in mean
relative abundance were directly attributable to sequence read
length and quality caused by nucleotide mismatches with the v 
reverse primer on the end meaningfully the v reverse primer
contained a degeneracy in the third nucleotide position and was
made to match both ttg and tta template sequences 
interestingly full length reads bp were only obtained for
sequences containing the ttg motif at the priming location se 
quences with tta corresponded to shortened reads � bp 
and the underrepresentation of community members the two
species that were not represented had a complete mismatch on the
 end ctg and the shortest reads � bp the exact rela 
tionship between primer mismatches and resultant short ampli 
cons will require further investigation while it is known that

primer mismatches disproportionately affect amplification effi 
ciency when located near the end these data suggest
that primers should be designed without degeneracies near the 
end as well differences in annealing temperature and specificity
between g c and a t nucleotides may have resulted in the higher
amplification of the ttg priming location melting temperature
 tm � °c over that of tta tm � °c given the previ 
ously recommended thermocycling conditions used for pcr am 
plification in this study minimum annealing temperature of
 °c this discrepancy along with the lack of coverage which
has been previously noted e g reference of the haptophytes
prymnesium parvum and isochrysis galbana represents a critical
shortcoming of the v primer set as used in the literature conse 
quently this study used a “modified” v reverse primer table 
v r without degeneracies on the end for the subsequent se 
quencing run 

effect of read overlap and clustering similarities on sequence
accuracy the lengths of forward and reverse reads and hence 
read overlap and clustering similarity affect the number of ob 
served otus it is common to use a similarity cutoff of or 
 to nominally express otus as taxonomic groupings at the
species level but it has been shown that a single threshold cannot
be set to operationally define a clustering threshold and relate it to
taxonomy in order to determine the appropriate sequence
similarity clustering cutoffs to apply to this data set read overlap
 i e minimum read length specified during quality filtering and
clustering thresholds were varied at multiple cutoff values and
compared to membership based distance i e jaccard index 
from the theoretical “even” mock community fig the goal of
this analysis was to select the minimum read overlap and cluster 
ing threshold that accurately represented the mock community
while retaining the most reads possible and reducing sequencing
noise as read overlap and similarity cutoff increased the distance

fig distance from the theoretical community jaccard dissimilarity at various overlaps between forward and reverse reads and clustering of otus based on
sequence similarity cutoffs for the v a and v v b regions using the “even” community mc the left hand y axis and gray line show the loss of reads
as the minimum read overlap increases increasing the read overlap decreases the jaccard dissimilarity but at the expense of loss of reads the v and v v 
regions are able to achieve a jaccard dissimilarity of � at clustering right hand y axis using and bp overlaps respectively

curacy but the number of reads included in the analyses also
decreased using a cost benefit relationship the number of reads
lost to the decrease in distance from theoretical we determined
the optimal cutoff values as the percentage of sequence similarity
and read overlap at which the minimal number of reads was lost

 i e benefit to less than for the v region this was deter 
mined to be a cutoff with a bp overlap bp read

 bp overlap at although this similarity cutoff is higher than

captured all mock community members with no loss of accuracy 
by selecting a cutoff sequencing noise was masked and spu 
rious otus were reduced 

examining the effect of read length and similarity cutoffs on
community accuracy in this way also aided in identifying potential
issues within the processed reads local minimums e g fig a 
read overlap of bp and sequence similarity of indicate
regions where increasing the read overlap requirement actually
increases the distance from theoretical which might result from
merging of paired end reads that meet defined base quality met 
rics but are still sequencing errors these points suggest that for
those samples read errors are making it through the quality filter 
ing steps and because the total number of sequences decreases
with quality filtering the effect of these sequencing errors is am 
plified for example increasing the read overlap from to bp
for the even mock community replicate of see fig s in the
supplemental material resulted in extraneous sequences and 
additional otus being displayed to unique sequences

ambiguous bases and instituting a minimum read length this
error was further reduced to after application of a sliding

the mean relative abundance of of the mock communities
 freshwater dominant even and marine dominant communities
 mc mc and mc respectively is shown in fig for the v 
and v v primer sets for additional mock communities see fig 
s in the supplemental material representation by the v v set
outperforms that of the v set for all communities with average
mean relative abundances of fold 	 fold and 
fold 	 fold underrepresented per detected mock community
member compared to the theoretical relative abundances for the
v v and v amplicons respectively although the v region
captures freshwater species relatively well fold 	 fold
underrepresented from theoretical it fails to adequately repre 
sent marine species fold 	 fold underrepresented from
theoretical often underrepresenting the haptophyte members by
as much as orders of magnitude coupled with the higher se 
quencing error of the haptophytes it is clear that the v region
does not adequately capture the community structure of the ma 

rine mock community and will not accurately represent samples
that contain these members unfortunately haptophytes are of
major importance to marine communities due to their contribu 
tion to open ocean biomass and production and these studies
most often leverage eukaryotic sequencing e g references 
 and 

recent studies have highlighted the suitability of the v region
for amplicon sequencing but these studies promote
primer locations that include both the v and v regions � 
bp long which is longer than the illumina miseq can currently
sequence with paired end reads � to bp with appropri 
ate read overlap until longer reads are possible and potentially
even after the v v region provides more accurate otu rela 
tive abundances across all mock communities tested in this study 
the v primer did capture both abundant and rare freshwater
taxa while the v v primer struggled with species either fresh 
water or marine that were at a low abundance however this is

fig mean relative abundances of freshwater dominant a and b even c and d and marine dominant e and f communities corresponding to mock
communities and mc mc and mc respectively as represented by the v a c and e blue and v v b d and f red regions the dashed lines
indicate the mean relative abundance of the theoretical community the v primer set consistently underrepresented the marine haptophyte members p parvum
and i galbana although the v v primer set struggled to represent members when in low abundance it more accurately represented the overall community

most likely an artifact of the amplification method used i e con 
centrations of reagents as well as the pcr cycle design and there
are multiple steps that can be taken to improve representation at
low abundance these include increasing primer and dntp con 
centrations to allow for increased amplification of rare sequences 
and the reduction of pcr cycles to minimize the overrepresenta 
tion of high abundance sequences additionally because most
wastewater algal communities are under high selective pressures
and are not very diverse the v v primer set will reliably capture
dominant organisms while v may miss a dominant organism 

to further examine the performance of the v and v v re 
gions four alpha diversity metrics were calculated richness based
metrics observed otus sobs and the chao rchao estimator 
which estimate the unsampled richness and structure based metrics
 nonparametric shannon index dnpshannon and inverse simpson
index dinvsimpson which measure sample diversity assuming no
underlying distribution and an even distribution respectively the
v and v v regions show similar trends p � and 
 welch’s t test with average sobs and dnpshannon values fig 
 a and b within and of the theoretical respectively 
beta diversity measurements including the richness based jac 
card djaccard and structure based bray curtis dbraycurtis 
distances were also calculated when the sequenced mock com 
munity distances from theoretical were compared the v v re 
gion more accurately represented the theoretical community in 
of and of mock communities using jaccard and bray curtis
metrics respectively fig c and d exceptions to this are
djaccard for mc and mc due to some of the rare taxa not

being detected if low abundance members were efficiently de 
tected by incorporating the approaches discussed previously it is
likely that the djaccard from the theoretical community would
also be smaller than that of the v region for these two commu 
nities 

application to environmental samples community compo 
sition at taxonomic ranks of and in mothur corresponding to
class level fig and genus level see fig s in the supplemental
material respectively shows that microbial populations for each
sample are similar as represented by either the v or v v re 
gion both the v and v v regions were able to differentiate

ment and secondary clarification p � amova see
fig s in general the v v region had a greater number of
observed otus and displayed higher levels of microbially di 
verse populations than the v region as estimated by using
alpha diversity metrics dnpshannon fig 

in order to examine the representation by each region of the
coastal samples more closely the bray curtis distances between
samples e g m and m m and m etc were compared be

samples from the v and v v regions with each region giving
different estimates of community dissimilarity between any two
samples and the v data displaying higher dissimilarities than the
v v data in of the pairwise comparisons however when
taken collectively the v and v v regions show similar trends
overall and a mantel test between the v and v v bray curtis
distance matrices showed a high degree of similarity p �
 the v region had fewer otus for of the marine
samples but surprisingly it represented organisms of the division
haptophyta as well as those of the v v region notably the
abundant genera found in environmental coastal samples all be 
longed to the class pavlovophyceae while the species present in
the mock community belonged to the class prymnesiophyceae it
is possible that the v region only struggles with representation of
the latter although additional mock community sequencing with
members of the class pavlovophyceae included would need to be
performed 

in order to directly compare differences in community repre 
sentation by the v and v v regions sequences were binned
into phylotypes and beta diversity metrics jaccard index and
bray curtis dissimilarity were calculated the v and v v re 
gions show different community representations of the same sam 
ple fig the bray curtis distance between the v commu 

nity representation of a sample and its v v representation
varies greatly with some samples showing good agreement w 
difference of between both regions and others showing high
dissimilarity w difference of variations in the commu 
nity representation by the v and v v regions do not corre 
spond to sample type i e freshwater coastal or wastewater but
rather are sample and site specific these results support the use of
multiple primer sets as in previous studies e g references and
 in order to provide a more complete picture of community
representation 

despite differences in community representation by each hy 
pervariable region as measured through the bray curtis dis 
tance the three data sets cluster according to their sample types
irrespective of the hypervariable region targeted see fig s in
the supplemental material furthermore although samples can
be differentiated according to sample type e g freshwater or
wastewater p � amova there is no significant difference
between the v samples and v v samples within the same type
of environmental sample e g v freshwater and v v freshwa 
ter p � amova 

in conclusion in this study we examined the effect of pcr 
sequencing bias on the representation of seven mock communi 
ties by targeting the v and v v hypervariable regions of the

fig community composition of the v top and v v bottom regions at a taxonomic rank of in mothur which corresponds to the class level samples

 s rrna gene by doing so we discovered that a previously used
primer set missed a major taxonomic group of interest to marine
studies this study highlights the need for mock communities to
validate the representation of species by amplicon sequencing in
silico testing can help identify sequence coverage and nucleotide
mismatches but experimental validation with mock communities
provides critical insight into the amplification sequencing and

representation of target regions specifically this study found that
nucleotide degeneracies on the primer end affected read lengths
and mean relative abundances of mock communities due to dif 
ferential amplification of templates containing g or a in the de 
generate position for v primers proposed in literature further 
more the pcr sequencing error is markedly higher for gc rich
members compared to an average for mock com 
munity importantly the v region failed to reliably capture 
of the mock community members included in this study the
v v region more accurately represents mean relative abun 
dance and alpha and beta diversity with the greatest improvement
in structure based metrics such as the bray curtis distance from
theoretical 

given the additional uncertainty of gene copy numbers across
eukaryotic species representation of even closely related organ 
isms such as phytoplankton by amplicon sequencing has a high
degree of ambiguity complementary approaches such as applica 
tion of diversity metrics only to similarly sized microalgae or
sequencing cell sorted populations might greatly improve
the accuracy of diversity metrics and mean relative abundance in
the case of marie et al the use of cell sorting allowed for the
sequencing of abundant phytoplankton e g haptophyta that
were previously undetected due to the profusion of larger organ 
isms the effect of pcr bias however skews diversity esti 
mates even when the gene copy number is kept the same based on
these results we recommend that studies that apply amplicon se 

fig observed otus a and nonparametric shannon index b of environmental samples by the v blue and v v red regions wastewater samples
were taken from primary effluent pe treatment or secondary effluent se streams from wastewater treatment plants both hypervariable regions show
significantly higher numbers of otus p � welch’s t test in the freshwater and coastal samples than in wastewater and similar representations of metrics
across all samples 

fig bray curtis distance between the v and v v representations of
the same sample community using a phylotype based approach community
representation by the v and v v regions varies in agreement on a sample 
by sample basis rather than across sample types i e freshwater coastal or

quencing to environmental samples do the following i use mock
communities composed of target species to estimate community
representation and pcr sequencing error by the chosen primer
set ii limit degenerate locations in primer sequences and elimi 
nate degeneracies in positions near the end and iii estimate
alpha and beta diversity metrics through structure based meth 
ods that provide more reliable approximations of community di 
versity 

in the current study redesign of the primer containing a de 
generacy on the end increased the representation of the marine
members and improved mock community representation overall 
ultimately the v v region provided the highest accuracy of the
selected mock community as measured through mean relative
abundance and beta diversity measurements djaccard and
dbraycurtis given these data we suggest that studies using
 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing for microalgal commu 
nities and marine studies in particular target the v v hy 
pervariable region when considering species included in this
study however the v and v v regions showed similar
overall representations of environmental samples and tradeoffs
between hypervariable regions may warrant the use of multiple
primer sets to better capture community diversity
