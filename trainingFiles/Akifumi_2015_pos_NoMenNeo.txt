abstract

the nuclear s rrna gene has been used as a metabarcoding marker in massively parallel sequencing mps based

environmental surveys for plankton biodiversity research however different hypervariable regions have been used

in different studies and their utility has been debated among researchers in this study detailed investigations into

 s rrna were carried out we investigated the effective number of sequences deposited in international nucleotide

sequence databases insds the amplification bias and the amplicon sequence variability among the three variable

regions v – v – and v – using in silico polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification based on insds we

also examined the primer universality and the taxonomic identification power using mps based environmental sur 

veys in the sea of okhotsk to determine which region is more useful for mps based monitoring the primer univer 

sality was not significantly different among the three regions but the number of sequences deposited in insds was

markedly larger for the v – region than for the other two regions the sequence variability was significantly differ 

ent with the highest variability in the v – region followed by the v – region and the lowest variability in the

v – region the results of the mps based environmental surveys showed significantly higher identification power

in the v – and v – regions than in the v – region but no significant difference was detected between the v – 

and v – regions we therefore conclude that the v – region will be the most suitable for future mps based moni 

toring of natural eukaryote communities as the number of sequences deposited in insds increases

introduction

new sequencing technologies such as the roche 

pyrosequencing platform have made it possible to obtain

millions of sequence reads in a single experiment and

massively parallel sequencing mps is currently revolu 

tionizing the survey of eukaryotic diversity medinger

et al as this technology enables the detection of

thousands of operational taxonomic units otus of

eukaryotes from various ecosystems and facilitates the

detection of low abundance populations in complex

eukaryote communities cheung et al nolte et al 

 edgcomb et al orsi et al lindeque et al 

 however this new technology brings with it

different sources of sequencing error to those present in

traditional dideoxy capillary sequencing such as ambi 

guity of homopolymer length particularly for long

homopolymers huse et al mps of pcr amplicon

libraries can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity

through the generation of low frequency error prone

reads huse et al for this reason empirical studies

to evaluate the per base accuracy of mps and to identify

factors that can be used to eliminate low quality reads

have been employed huse et al quince et al 

 schloss et al li et al 

a fundamental problem in metagenome analyses is

the taxonomic identification of dna sequence fragments

derived from environmental samples as identification

accuracy has a direct impact on biodiversity comparisons

and the interpretations drawn from them bazinet 

cummings therefore several different methods

have been proposed for accomplishing this effectively

and efficiently and many have been implemented in

software design bazinet cummings evaluated

the performance of the leading programs in each cate 

gory using data sets of known taxonomic and functional

composition they found significant variability in identi 

fication accuracy precision and efficiency in the

sequence identification programs but did not recom 

mend any particular program 

dna barcoding is a technique that uses a short stan 

dardized dna region to identify species or higher taxa

 hebert et al large public reference libraries of

dna barcodes are being developed for animals hebert

et al plants cbol plant working group 

and fungi schoch et al but there is no general

agreement on which region to use especially for protists

 pawlowski et al the number of catalogued pro 

tistan species should still be small in comparison with

the diversity of animals plants and fungi the numbers

range from excluding marine nonphotosyn 
thetic protists mora et al to hoef emden
et al and by the cbol protist working
group prowg pawlowski et al until recently 

nuclear ribosomal rna genes such as s s and the

its s its regions or protein coding genes such as

coi and rbcl have been applied to eukaryote phylogeny

and diversity research machida et al pawlowski

et al stern et al toju et al hirai et al 

 the s rrna gene has commonly been

employed as a dna barcoding metabarcoding dna

materials and methods

in silico pcr analyses

extraction of target sequences from insds and comparison of

the effective numbers of registration therein identification

power through dna barcoding is greatly dependent on

the number of sequences at target regions deposited in

insds to compare the effective numbers of sequences

deposited in insds among the three regions v – v – 
and v – of s rrna we extracted the sequences that
contain the three regions using in silico pcr with the aid

of ecopcr v bellemain et al for this in silico

pcr we constructed a genus level identified sequence

database without tetrapods and land plants based on the

national center for biotechnology information nucleo 

tide database ncbi nt downloaded on may 

this sequence database contains nucleotide

sequences the primer sequences expected amplicon

length and specified range of amplicon length given to

ecopcr are shown in table in this in silico pcr zero to

three mismatches between target sequences and each pri 

mer sequence were allowed but no mismatch was

allowed in the two bases at the end sequences that
contained poly n longer than bp in the amplified

region were excluded from the results and only the

amplicon sequences without primer annealing positions

containing eukaryote s rdna were selected by metaxa

v bengtsson et al we carried out clustering

of the amplicon sequences obtained from in silico pcr

by cd hit est v li godzik at levels of

sequence identity of and to

avoid phylogenetic and taxonomic biases of the number

of deposited sequences the additional command line

parameters ‘ n a d r p g ’ were given in the

sequence clustering we counted the number of repre 

sentative sequences as the effective numbers of depos 

ited sequences

on in silico pcr from the overall sequences of ncbi nt

sequences clustering of the extracted sequences at levels

of sequence identity of and was

carried out by cd hit est v li godzik with

the additional command line parameters ‘ n a d

 r p g ’ five new databases of s s 

 s s and s containing 

 and representative sequences respectively 

were constructed to obtain three subset databases for

the v – v – and v – regions from the five databases 
three sets of primer pairs namely ssu f ssu r 

tareuk fwd tareukrev and ssu f ssu 

r were used table and in silico pcr was car 

ried out by ecopcr to make databases in total in the in

silico amplification zero to three mismatches between

each target primer and the template sequence except

mismatches at the two bases of the end of the primers 
were allowed and amplicon lengths were limited as

shown in table to amplify the target regions the

sequences that contained poly n longer than bp were

excluded from the results percentages of in silico ampli 

fication success among the three primer sets primer uni 

versality were compared in every database with

different sequence identity thresholds in clustering of

 representative sequences extracted by in silico pcr

using ssu f and ssu r primers after clustering at

the sequence identity of the numbers of shared

sequences among the different primer sets were also

counted and depicted as venn diagrams 

comparison of sequence variability among the three variable

regions we calculated the edit distance between all pair 

wise amplicon sequences within each database n 
to evaluate the potential identification power among the

three regions the edit distances were calculated by all 

against all pairwise global alignment by the needleman–
wunsch algorithm between all pairwise amplicon

sequences with the aid of the ‘needle’ command in em 

boss package v rice et al and our own perl

script primer positions were removed from the analysis 

and each insertion and deletion was counted as one vari 

ation even if it was longer than bp the edit distances

among the three variable regions were compared at each

level of sequence identity by the kruskal–wallis test and
post hoc multiple comparison based on sheffe’s method

difference in the sequence variability sequence identity

evaluation method the sequence variability was evalu 

ated based on in silico edit distance analysis and

sequence identity was accounted as percentage identity

in otu picking of mps based environmental surveys 

because the v – amplicon is the longest it has smallest
percentage sequence variation unlike its edit distance 

the other explanations are that the samples used in our

environmental surveys are limited geographically and

temporally and do not represent the biome on the earth 

or that the pcr or sequencing of v – region was less
universal on these samples in total of three regions the

primer pair takano horiguchi the eukaryotic

 s rrna gene contains eight hypervariable regions v 

to v excluding v that are sufficiently variable to allow

the identification of species using the sequence data

available in public databases ki however there is

a lack of consensus on which is the most appropriate

marker region with different hypervariable regions in

 s rrna being used in different studies such as the v 

region medinger et al nolte et al the v – 
region monchy et al the v region cheung et al 

 stoeck et al comeau et al monier et al 

 the v – region pernice et al and the v 
region amaral zettler et al stoeck et al 

behnke et al edgcomb et al pawlowski et al 

 researchers have used different hypervariable

regions for several reasons for example the v – region
has been reported to provide accurate phylogenies with

the resulting analysis providing a good description of

the variability of the entire s rrna gene pernice et al 

 however the v region has apparently failed to

retrieve specific groups for high level taxa lacking repre 

sentations of whole gene variability in s rrna paw 

lowski et al pernice et al in contrast to this

assessment another study has shown that an amplicon

library for the v region retrieved a greater number of

higher rank taxonomic groups than the v region and

that this trend was strong for dinoflagellates – one of the
most dominant protists in coastal ecosystems stoeck

et al some discrepancies could also be due to the

fig comparison of the operational taxonomic unit otu accumulation curves among the three variable regions in s rrna v – 
v – and v – in massively parallel sequencing mps based environmental surveys otus were picked using sequence identity cut 
offs of and from amplicon mps data from the sea of okhotsk the otu accumulation curves were drawn with the aid of the

rarecurve function of the vegan v package for the r statistical environment the red black and blue lines indicate the samples of

v – v – and v – regions respectively

validity of s rrna as metabarcoding markers 



different lengths of amplicon sequences – and conse 
quently different amounts of phylogenetic information –
leading to both differences in species diversity bachy

et al and taxonomic composition amaral zettler

et al in one study the sequence variability in the

hypervariable regions of the s rrna gene in dinoflag 

ellates was thoroughly analysed showing that the v 

region had the highest taxonomic resolving power of all

eight hypervariable regions ki however the use 

fulness of the hypervariable regions as barcoding mark 

ers and for molecular detection has not yet been fully

evaluated for a wide range of eukaryotes because there

is a lack of understanding of the factors influencing the

identification power for taxa therefore the objective of

this study was to determine which region is most vari 

able and useful as a metabarcoding marker for the appli 

cation of pyrosequencing technology in order to

study plankton biodiversity in natural environmental

samples 

primer universality

to standardize the template sequence data sets we first

amplified a sequence containing regions v to v by in

silico pcr from the full ncbi nt and env nt databases

using ssu f and ssu r primers allowing six mis 

matches these primers may have been better suited for

the amplification of the v – and v – regions than for
the v – region because one primer of each primer pair
was used to amplify the v – region which may have
resulted in the overestimation of amplification success

rate for these two regions this effect should be taken

into account for interpreting pcr coverage among the

three sets of primer pairs the amplification success rate

was the highest – for primer set regardless of
clustering levels except for a sequence identity threshold

of allowing for two to three mismatches however 

all primer sets amplified at least of the sequences

allowing for three mismatches at a sequence identity

threshold of in clustering fig in addition the

frequency in the number of sequences amplified by a

single primer pair out of the total number of sequences

obtained using all the primer sets was allowing
for three mismatches of the primers fig the phy 

lum level taxonomic composition of the amplified

sequences was significantly different in the in silico

analyses of region v – suggesting that potential uni 
versality of primer set was less than the other primer

sets however the taxonomic composition of all three

regions was not significantly different in the mps based

environmental surveys this result indicates that primer

universality is sufficiently high among all three primer

sets although pawlowski et al and pernice et al 

 have pointed out the failure of taxonomic

recovery in specific groups for high level taxa in the v 

region 

comparison of the utility of the three variable regions as
metabarcoding markers

the number of deposited sequences of v – was – 
times larger than that of v – and – times larger than
that of v – fig sequence variability was highest in
v – and lowest in v – the frequency distribution of
edit distance was significantly different among the three

regions regardless of the identity levels in clustering

 fig the results of mps based environmental sur 

veys of planktonic eukaryote communities indicated

that the identification power by use of primer sets 

 v – and v – was significantly higher than for
primer set v – at the two different cut off levels of
 and but they were not significantly different

between primer sets and accordingly these results

suggest that the identification power reflects the

sequence variability among hypervariable regions 

rather than the number of registrations in insds we

can conclude that the v – region is more suitable than
the v – region for environmental monitoring based on
roche pyrosequencing technology moreover the

v – region will become more useful and informative
as the number of sequences deposited in public data 

bases increases the v – region is the longest in the
three regions and the amplicon length of this region is

too long for illumina miseq hiseq overlapped paired 

end sequencing at present the v – region can be rec 
ommended for such sequencing technology because of

shorter length we also encourage to use multiple

regions for reducing pcr biases
