keywords biofilms lichens stone monuments biogenic weathering protection treatments

with this paper i focus on a topic that 
in my opinion is worth consideration
by scientific community involved in the
conservation of cultural heritage as far
the role that biofilms and lichens play in
the weathering of natural and artificial
stones an increasing number of researches
account for a negligible effect and even for
a protection thus the axiomatic corre 
lation among biofilms lichens and stone
weathering is matter of controversy these
researches bring a novel perspective in
a field where many studies showed that
biofilms and lichens do damage stones in
this paper i report some results that in my
opinion add significant contributions and
useful information to the subject 

the microflora of outdoor stone mon 
uments represents a complex ecosystem
including bacteria algae fungi lichens 
microorganisms colonize stonework
whenever the conditions of moisture 
light temperature and nutrition are favor 
able when a biological colonization is
evident the conservator should verify at
which extent it damages the materials
and know the non biogenic agents that
take part in the degradation warscheid 
 many causes have similar effects 
act in synergy or interact in quantitatively
variable relations thus the relevance of
biological impact to the entire deterio 
ration process should be evaluated very
carefully detecting microorganisms on
heritage objects does not automatically
imply that they actually change the chem 
ical composition or physical properties of
the materials a study of different kind of
sandstone from wyoming covered with
lichens and old petroglyphs chiari and
cossio demonstrated for example

that lichens were not one of the key factors
in the conservation of the petroglyphs 
either in a negative destruction of the
outermost layer or in a positive way pro 
tection from rain sun etc lichens filled
the gaps between the grains which were
large enough to host them without exer 
cising relevant pressure porosity was less
toward the outside since in the outer layer
lichens occluded the pores counting the
lichen thallus the porosity proved to be
the same as in the core of the rock the
deterioration of the sandstone depended
mainly on the nature of the sandstone
itself in particular on the dimension of
the quartz grains the larger the grains 
the greater the porosity water absorption 
fragility and de cohesion of the sand 
stone the results may help decide whether
to eliminate the lichens from the surface
and to account the need for their removal
to aesthetic or site management reasons
rather than to chemical physical reasons 

another stimulating study investigated
the interaction over time among biofilms 
lichens and sandstone and compared the
behavior of siliceous rocks with that of
carbonate ones in relation to biological
growth hoppert et al the authors
hypothesized that lithobiontic organisms
temporarily stabilize loosely to moder 
ately cemented sandstones when com 
plex biofilms and lichens with moderate
metabolic and reproductive rates colo 
nize the rock in high densities pre 
vention of rapid decomposition of the
stone is necessary to enable undis 
turbed growth over several years or even
decades complex microbial communities
and lichens protect the substratum from
rapid decomposition by formation of a

tight network of cells and extracellular
polymers which surround the mineral
particles e g quartz enwrapping the
grains with a biogenic matrix temporarily
stabilizes the surface and reduces weath 
ering which may allow the organisms to
persist for years on the contrary microor 
ganisms contrive a different pattern of
growth in homogeneous carbonate rocks 
actively boring cavities without regard of
the pre existing rock fabric however a
structural weakening of the substratum
involving the risk of sudden desquama 
tion and destruction of the endolithic
environment create by microorganisms is
uncommon thus on carbonate substrata 
endoliths with their relatively slow growth
rates compared to epiliths have a chance
for a sustainable life for long periods 
the authors deduced that on homoge 
neous carbonate substrata maintenance
of a stable population for tens of years
accounts for a “sustainable” use of the rock
substratum they suggested it is a spe 
cial feature of lichens that develop over
decades understanding their strategies for
colonization may be important for a vari 
ety of aspects concerning biogenic stone
deterioration 

a survey of four sandstone heritage
structures in central belfast exposed for
around years and colonized by green
algae biofilms cutler et al showed
that algal patches were associated with
less weathered surfaces i e harder algal
patches were associated with lower coef 
ficient of variation of surface hardness 
this might indicate that green algal cover
had a broadly bio protective role

pinna biofilms and lichens on stone monuments

temple located in angkor wat cambodia 
suggested that lichens had an impor 
tant moisture controlling function for
the environmentally stressed stones
 warscheid and leisen the mea 
surement of the capillary water uptake
at different places on the temple showed
that lichens protected the stone from rapid
water uptake whereas certain algal and
blackened cyanobacteria biofilms signifi 
cantly increased it rebound hardness and
drill resistance measurements taken on
lichens did not show any evidence that
they significantly affected the mechanical
properties of the stones consequently 
the authors stated that the lichens regu 
lated the humidity thermal transmission 
and water vapor diffusion reducing
thermo hygric stresses to the stone 

under conditions of high abiotic
weathering lichens can provide protection
from wind and rain to the stone surface
 carballal et al bungartz et al 
 or limit erosion by reducing the
level of water within the rock garcia 
vallès et al their retention of
moisture within the thallus reduced ther 
mal stress on a limestone surface carter
and viles according to ariño et al 
 and wendler and prasartet 
lichens can have a protective effect against
the natural decay of porous stones by
decreasing either the intensity of water
exchanges between the substrate and the
environment or the damage by atmo 
spheric agents wind rain pollutants 
salt aerosol more widespread exfolia 
tion saline efflorescences flaking and
honeycombing of non colonized surface
supported this hypothesis 

all the quoted papers give relevant
suggestions to deepen the knowledge of
the role of biofilms and lichens in con 
servation of stone the measurements
of the capillary water uptake and the
surface hardness of colonized and non 
colonized materials the drill resistance
measurements taken on lichens the mea 
surements of the surface porosity of
a colonized stone compared with that
of the core of the rock are scientific
methods suitable to develop the stud 
ies on the interaction between microflora
and stones moreover the knowledge of
biofilms strategies for colonization would
be relevant to understand whether they
are capable to stabilize poorly cemented

stones as the literature concerning the
degradation of stone by lichens is copious 
well documented and has experimentally
proved any confutation must provide an
equal weight of proof in order to be
considered valid piervittori et al 
many authors showed that lichens are
indeed generally defacing and intrinsi 
cally damaging moreover the decay of the
lichen thallus which occurs on the center
of the colonies of some species can open
the underlying area to further weathering 
resulting in cratered mounts on the rock
surface mottershead and lucas 
although the protective effects of lichens
deserve further research this aspect can 
not be generalized and each case should
be examined on its own merits 

despite the numerous literature dealing
with the damage of the materials colo 
nized by biofilms see reviews in caneva
et al and scheerer et al 
the relationship between mineral solubility
and the role of microbial surface colo 
nization in weathering reactions is a topic
that has yet to be answered in a compre 
hensive manner davis and luttge 
the precise role of mineral solubility and
hence dissolution rate in determining the
extent and rate of microbial surface col 
onization is largely unknown moreover 
the relative importance of various weath 
ering mechanisms as a function of species
composition rock type and external con 
ditions moisture temperature pollution 
and climate needs further studies 

an interesting work gutarowska
and zakowska deals with a very
important topic of research that is the
quantification of risk by fungal growth on
surfaces although the work did not focus
on materials of cultural heritage it can
be relevant all the same it correlated the
amount of ergosterol to the cfu number
of fungi inoculated on samples made of
concrete gypsum board emulsion coat 
brick and plaster ergosterol is a basic
sterol of cellular membranes in filamen 
tous fungi and yeast ergosterol content
lower than mg m corresponds to
the normal level of spores contamina 
tion without any active growth values
ranging – mg m indicate the acti 
vation of mycelium growth and those over
 mg m reveal active fungal growth
and high contamination based on them
it could be possible to estimate the level

of fungal contamination of materials also
when the mycelium is inactive and cannot
be detected using traditional methods 

the role of lichens in stone weathering
strictly related to the removal treatments 
a few recent articles are a plea for greater
consideration when treating exterior stone
covered in lichens although their removal
from tombstones sculptures and monu 
ments is widely practiced it can damage
the stone and in the case of extensive and
repeated use of biocides the environment 
for example the mechanical removal of
crustose lichens is particularly difficult
because the thallus forms an intimate
association with the substrate hence its
removal leads to severe structural dam 
age scheerer et al rather than
resort to mechanical or biocidal clean 
ing all of which have major disadvantages 
sheppard favors minimal inter 
vention proposing non destructive doc 
umenting recording of the monuments
and letting the lichens contribute to the
aesthetics of churchyards and cemeter 
ies moreover certain forms of biologi 
cal growth can have a scarcity or rarity
that must be taken into account when
planning conservation work watt 
where churchyards are concerned there
may also be a preference for conserving
bio diversity including ferns and lichens
on monuments 

in conclusion i think that the scien 
tific community involved in this field is
mature enough to go beyond the studies
reporting just unending lists of species in
my opinion the assessment of a “common
language ” of standard test methods for
the evaluation of the damage by biofilms
and lichens see as an example the paper by
gutarowska and zakowska is very impor 
tant standard test procedures are essential
to compare the results of different labora 
tories and to interpret understand and
evaluate the research the application of
standard procedures will ultimately result
in proposing indexes of risk or danger of
biofilms and lichens on different stones
