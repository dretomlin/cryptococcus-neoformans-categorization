estimates of soil microbial diversity

extracellular dna from dead microorganisms can persist in soil
for weeks to years – although it is implicitly assumed that the
microbial dna recovered from soil predominantly represents
intact cells it is unclear how extracellular dna affects molecu 
lar analyses of microbial diversity we examined a wide range
of soils using viability pcr based on the photoreactive dna 
intercalating dye propidium monoazide we found that on
average of both prokaryotic and fungal dna was extra 
cellular or from cells that were no longer intact extracellular
dna inflated the observed prokaryotic and fungal richness by
up to and caused significant misestimation of taxon rela 
tive abundances including the relative abundances of taxa inte 
gral to key ecosystem processes extracellular dna was not
found in measurable amounts in all soils it was more likely to
be present in soils with low exchangeable base cation concen 
trations and the effect of its removal on microbial community
structure was more profound in high ph soils together 
these findings imply that this ‘relic dna’ remaining in soil
after cell death can obscure treatment effects spatiotemporal
patterns and relationships between microbial taxa and
environmental conditions 

microbes play critical roles in terrestrial biogeochemistry and the
maintenance of soil fertility microbiologists biogeochemists and
ecologists now routinely use dna based approaches such as ampli 
con marker gene sequencing quantitative polymerase chain reac 
tion qpcr and shotgun metagenomics to determine the
composition and diversity of soil microbial communities these
methods have advanced our understanding of terrestrial micro 
biology in a myriad of ways by revealing that thousands of
microbial taxa can inhabit a single gram of soil – uncovering
novel soil microbial diversity and identifying putative
functions of undescribed taxa 

linking the activities of microbes to soil processes necessitates
distinguishing viable cells both metabolically active and dormant
cells from those that are dead previous work has shown that
after a cell dies amplifiable extracellular dna can persist in soils
for weeks to years reviewed in refs – the longevity and size
of this extracellular dna pool is controlled by a myriad of
complex physical and biological factors for example soil mineral 
ogy ph and ionic strength can control the sorption of dna to the
soil matrix as well as the molecular integrity of the dna itself 
sorbed extracellular dna has reduced accessibility to microbes 
thereby limiting its removal from the environment by anabolic or
catabolic processes or as a source of transformable genetic material
 reviewed in ref although it is well established that soils can
harbour significant amounts of extracellular dna we do not

understand how this extracellular dna pool may influence
dna based assessments of soil microbial communities 

given the potential for extracellular dna to persist in soil we
hypothesized that extracellular dna may obscure dna based esti 
mates of the diversity and structure of soil microbial commu 
nities differentiating between dna originating from living
microbes versus extracellular sources is important because ecologi 
cal definitions of community level diversity and structure should
only encompass organisms that are alive in a sample here we
define ‘relic dna’ as dna that is either extracellular or in cells
that are no longer intact and thus removed by the photoreactive via 
bility pcr indicator propidium monoazide pma we report
the amount of microbial dna derived from relic dna pools and
show how relic dna affects the observed richness and composition
of microbial communities we also identify which soil character 
istics are linked to greater relic dna effects and discuss the impli 
cations of relic dna on molecular analyses of microbial
communities in soil and other environments 

results and discussion
we investigated the effect of relic dna on microbial diversity esti 
mates in soils collected from a wide variety of ecosystem types
across the usa selected to encompass a broad range in edaphic
characteristics supplementary table sub samples of each soil
were either treated with pma n or left untreated n 
pma is a photoreactive dna intercalating dye that is generally
excluded by cells with intact membranes but binds relic dna
 extracellular dna and dna of cells with compromised cyto 
plasmic membranes when exposed to light intercalated pma
permanently modifies dna rendering it un amplifiable by pcr 
we used qpcr to calculate the amount of relic dna by subtracting
the abundance of amplifiable prokaryotic s rrna genes or fungal
internal transcribed spacer its amplicons in pma treated
samples dna from intact cells from the abundance of these
amplicons in untreated samples total dna dna from intact
cells relic dna microbial communities were characterized
by high throughput sequencing of amplified rrna gene regions
 s rrna for prokaryotes or the its region for fungi from both
pma treated and untreated soil sub samples we compared esti 
mates of microbial richness overall community composition and
the relative abundances of individual taxa after standardizing all
libraries to equivalent sequencing depths 

relic dna represented a large fraction of microbial dna in many
soils across all soils ± mean ± s e n of ampli 
fiable prokaryotic s rrna genes were derived from the relic dna
pool ‘all soils’ fig a similar patterns were observed for fungi

where ± mean ± s e n of fungal its amplicons
originated from the relic dna pool ‘all soils’ fig b several
lines of evidence suggest that these estimates of the percent of relic
dna are conservative first because some dead cells retain intact
membranes pma probably underestimates dead cell concen 
trations second when we experimentally added extracellular
dna to soil our approach completely removed the added extracellu 
lar dna from most soil samples but only reduced extracellular dna
spiked into a soil with large amounts of relic dna supplementary
fig this demonstrates that our approach is effective across a
broad range of soil types and is conservative in soils where relic
dna is abundant conversely it is unlikely that our approach
removed dna from living cells because studies have shown the
effects of pma on intact microbial cells are minimal and pma pri 
marily targets extracellular dna or dna from cells that are no
longer intact our own tests confirmed pma treatment
did not significantly reduce the amount of dna from live
escherichia coli or saccharomyces cerevisiae cells spiked into buffer
 supplementary fig and we did not observe relic dna in
all soils fig a b suggesting that pma treatment did not inflate
estimates of the percent relic dna by entering live cells 

removal of relic dna significantly reduced estimates of soil
microbial diversity across all samples the total prokaryotic richness
was reduced by ± mean ± s e n after relic dna
was removed fig c in soils the prokaryotic richness was sig 
nificantly lower by up to after relic dna was removed two 
tailed t test q value of ≤ fig c the percent decrease in the
number of prokaryotic taxa after relic dna was removed was posi 
tively correlated with the proportional abundance of s rrna
genes present in the relic dna pool supplementary fig a that
is soils with more relic dna tended to have lower richness once
relic dna was removed similar results were observed when we
analysed fungal dna fungal richness decreased by an average of
 ± mean ± s e n after relic dna was removed
 fig d the percent decrease in fungal richness after relic dna
removal was significant in soils two tailed t test q value of
≤ and reduced estimates of fungal diversity by up to fig d 

removal of relic dna can substantially reduce estimates of soil
microbial diversity indicating that commonly used molecular

methods for assessing soil microbial diversity may inflate richness
estimates due to the detection of dna from cells that are unlikely
to be viable however similar to previous studies the removal of
relic dna did not result in a significant reduction of prokaryotic
diversity in several soils fig c suggesting that in some soils 
the diversity detected in the relic dna pool is reflective of the diver 
sity obtained in the total dna pool similarly although an average
of ∼ of the total fungal dnawas derived from relic dna pools
 fig b the effect of relic dna removal on fungal richness was
variable across the soils examined as highlighted by the lack of a sig 
nificant correlation between the percent fungal relic dna and the
percent decrease in richness after relic dna removal
 supplementary fig b these between sample differences in the
magnitude of the effects of relic dna on estimates of fungal diver 
sity may be a product of differences in the temporal variability of
fungal communities at individual sites

 s rrna gene or its amplicons per gram in untreated soil spearman’s
ρ − p for prokaryotes and ρ − p for
fungi this correlation is probably the result of the communities
in replicate sub samples being more distinct from one another
when overall biomass is lower an effect that is taken into account
in our statistical analyses 

the relative abundances of numerous microbial lineages changed
after the removal of relic dna but the taxa that changed and the
direction of observed shifts varied across soils for example in a
grassland soil from the northeastern usa soil actinobacteria
and α proteobacteria significantly increased in relative abundance
after relic dna was removed but verrucomicrobia decreased
 fig in many cases the changes in estimated relative abundances
after relic dna removal approached or exceeded fig the
relative abundances of α proteobacteria were consistently greater
after relic dna removal mann–whitney u two tailed p≤ 
 supplementary fig a suggesting that the relative abundances
of viable α proteobacteria are underestimated in many soil
studies in contrast agaricomycete fungi were significantly less
abundant after relic dna was removed mann–whitney u two 
tailed p≤ supplementary fig b suggesting that either
agaricomycetes are less abundant than commonly reported or
other fungal taxa are relatively more abundant after relic dna
removal or viable agaricomycetes are broadly permeable to
pma these results highlight that the effects of relic dna removal
vary depending on the taxon in question are not predictable
a priori and vary depending on the soil in question 

relating the relative abundances of microbial taxa or protein 
coding genes to soil biogeochemical process rates has been challen 
ging hindering attempts to link microbial communities to the
ecosystem level processes they can control because the relative
abundances of living microbial populations may be considerably
higher or lower than estimated based on analyses of the total
dna pool the presence of relic dna probably obscures correlations
between the relative abundances of individual microbial taxa and
specific biogeochemical processes for example in several soils relic
dna resulted in the misestimation of the relative abundances of
ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria

 nob by supplementary fig a b we use aoa and nob
as examples because these taxa were relatively abundant across all
soils and several studies have attempted to link their abundances to
nitrification rates for example ref as another example we
found that the measured abundances of glomeraceae a family of arbus 
cular mycorrhizal fungi important to plant health increased by 
in two soils and decreased by in seven soils after removal of relic
dna supplementary fig c thus failure to remove relic dna before
investigating relationships between specific soil processes and dna 
based quantification of abundances can obscure associations between
microbial abundances and key soil processes 

consistent with previous studies we found that edaphic
characteristics known to influence electrostatic interactions
between dna and soil particles were significant predictors of the
presence of microbial relic dna table for example soils
with few exchangeable bases especially k were likely to contain
relic dna from both prokaryotic and fungal sources table and
supplementary fig although soils with low ph electrical con 
ductivity and cation exchange capacity were more likely to harbour
relic dna this pattern was stronger for prokaryotes than for fungi
 table interestingly ph predicted the magnitude of the overall
change in both prokaryotic and fungal community composition
after relic dna removal as soils with higher ph were likely to
have larger community differences after relic dna was removed
 supplementary fig however the proportional abundance of
relic dna was not correlated with the community differences
after pma treatment supplementary table these results high 
light that the effects of relic dna are variable across different soil
types in particular both prokaryotic and fungal relic dna is
more likely to be present in soils with few exchangeable base
cations below ∼ meq per g table but the microbial
community differences apparent after relic dna removal are
more pronounced in higher ph soils supplementary fig 

our finding that relic dna can lead to significant overestimation
of soil microbial diversity and reduce the ability to accurately quan 
tify prokaryotic and fungal community structure has several impor 
tant implications first it suggests that the actual microbial diversity
in soil is lower than often reported fig second although the

presence of relic dna is unlikely to obscure broad biogeographical
patterns for example those reported in refs – relic dna may
obscure subtle spatiotemporal patterns or treatment effects in exper 
imental manipulations of soil conditions for example shifts in soil
microbial communities across seasons or with plant species
growing on a site are often difficult to detect from dna based ana 
lyses similarly long term soil transplant experiments investi 
gating the effects of climate change on soil microbial communities

have shown minimal change in microbial community compo 
sition we expect that the ability to detect meaningful shifts in
soil microbial communities should increase if the ‘noise’ generated
from non living microbes is reduced by first removing relic dna 
finally the extreme diversity of soil microbial communities presents
multiple computational problems for metagenomic assembly and
analysis because a significant portion of this diversity is coming
from relic dna pools removal of relic dna from samples before
shotgun metagenomic analyses should result in more effective meta 
genomic assemblies and improve our ability to infer the genomic
attributes of undescribed soil microbes 

relic dna dynamics may have important ramifications for under 
standing microbial communities in other ecosystems besides soil for
example deep sea sediments harbour large amounts of extracellular
dna suggesting that removal of relic dnamay affect diversity esti 
mates in the deep biosphere specific analyses of the relic dna pool
in deep biosphere samples may have particular utility as a ‘fossil
record’ to distinguish extinct microbial taxa from living organisms
and more accurately reconstruct the subsurface paleome more
generally relic dna probably influences studies where dna from
dead organisms is abundant or where dna is particularly resistant
to degradation including studies of the microbes found on aquatic
particles on mineral surfaces or in the built environment

pma treatment and dna extraction ten replicate sub samples of each soil g 
were homogenized and resuspended in ml sterile pbs ph in transparent
plastic tubes pmawas added to five of the sub samples the pma treated at a final
concentration of µm in a dark room the concentration of µm pmawas used
because it is in the range of concentrations used in other studies for example 
refs our own experiments showed µm was sufficient to remove spikes of
naked extracellular dna in six soils supplementary fig and our own
laboratory experiments also showed insignificant penetration into exponentially
growing e coli or s cerevesiae supplementary fig the five pma treated and the
five untreated sub samples were gently vortexed for min in the dark at room
temperature after the incubation both pma treated and untreated samples were
exposed to a w halogen lamp placed cm from the sample tubes for four
consecutive s s light dark cycles while continually vortexing after light
exposure samples were frozen at − °c until dna extraction dna was extracted
from µl of homogenized soil pbs slurry using a mobio powersoil dna
extraction kit following the manufacturer’s instructions transferring µl of the
bead beaten supernatant for dna extraction to enable comparisons of relic dna
amounts across samples we treated each soil type identically 

rationale for using pma and method limitations several techniques have been
developed to investigate microbial viability in different environments reviewed in
ref the advantages of the pma based approach we apply here include the
following it is relatively easy to implement meaning it can be used for high 
throughput analyses the utility of pma for the purposes of distinguishing
extracellular dna from dna contained within cells is well documented and
typically conservative relative to ethidium monoazide based studies because not all
dead cells are permeable to pma – and key assumptions in other
approaches remain untested although rrna based approaches are thought to
discriminate between metabolically active and inactive cells this is not necessarily
true furthermore the assumption that extracellular rrna cannot persist in soil
has not been explicitly tested it is possible that as with dna there could be
substantial amounts of rrna in soil coming from extracellular pools or cells that are
no longer living but additional studies are required to determine if this is the case 

in some laboratory studies of pure bacterial cultures grown on nutrient rich
medium a fraction of the presumably viable population was found to be susceptible
to pma – thus one potential limitation of this technique is that the effectiveness
of pma exclusion by intact cells has not been tested on the broad diversity of
microbes found in soil however consistent with previous work reviewed in
refs we observed that few taxa were consistently under or over estimated
across soil samples after relic dna was removed suggesting that there are minimal
systematic taxon specific differences in the susceptibility of intact cells to pma
treatment supplementary fig a second potential limitation is that in turbid
sample preparations such as soils the effectiveness of pma binding of relic dna
may be reduced because of pma adsorption to soil particles or ineffective
photoactivation of pma ref and references therein in our experiments pma
retained the capacity to completely remove naked dna spikes in all but one soil
sample supplementary fig this suggests that in this study the photoactivation
of pma was sufficient and pma adsorption to soil particles was negligible

reads were processed as described previously briefly raw amplicon sequences were

statistical analyses the percent relic dna was calculated by comparing the mean
qpcr abundances n sub samples of s rrna genes or its amplicons from
untreated soil to the abundances of the amplicons from each individual pma 
treated sub sample n by subtracting the abundance of the targeted gene in each
pma treated sub sample from the mean abundance in untreated samples and then
dividing this difference by the mean abundance in untreated samples the percent
decrease in microbial richness after relic dna removal was calculated from rarefied
amplicon data by comparing the mean prokaryotic or fungal richness determined
from sub samples n of untreated soil to the prokaryotic or fungal richness
determined from each individual pma treated sub sample n by subtracting the
richness prokaryotic or fungal in each pma treated sub sample from the mean
richness prokaryotic or fungal in untreated samples divided by the mean richness
 prokaryotic or fungal in untreated samples because the replicates are sub samples
of a given soil and thus unlikely to harbour identical communities we focused on
overall differences in richness and did not specifically identify which taxa were
exclusively found in the relic dna pool microbial richness and bray–curtis
dissimilarities were calculated in the mctoolsr r package bray–curtis
dissimilarities were calculated on square root transformed taxon relative
abundances where appropriate statistical tests were corrected for multiple
comparisons using the qvalue r package using a significance threshold of
q value≤ spearman correlation coefficients and associated p values were
calculated with the hmisc r package logistic regression models were used to
identify which edaphic characteristics predicted the presence of relic dna our
rationale for using logistic regression for this analysis is that although we obtained
negative median relic dna percentages fig there cannot be less than relic
dna it is likely that our estimates of negative relic dna amounts are the result of
small scale heterogeneity in the proportional abundance of relic dna across sub 
samples of a given soil this heterogeneity probably obscures our ability to accurately
quantify the precise amount of relic dnawhen the amounts are near zero for these
logistic analyses we defined relic dna as being present in soils with 
prokaryotic relic dna and fungal relic dna these cutoffs were chosen
because they are ± the most negative median percent relic dnavalue across all soils 

data availability raw sequence data are available in the ncbi sequence read

of each taxa per soil per treatment and amplicon copies per replicate per gram of soil
