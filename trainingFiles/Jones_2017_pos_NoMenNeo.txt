advances in sequencing technologies continue to provide unprecedented opportunities to characterizemicrobial
communities for example the pacific biosciences single molecule real time smrt platform has emerged as a
unique approach harnessing dna polymerase activity to sequence template molecules enabling long reads at
low costs with the aim to simultaneously classify and enumerate in situ microbial populations we developed
a quantitative smrt qsmrt approach that involves the addition of exogenous standards to quantify ribosomal
amplicons derived fromenvironmental samples the v – regions of s ssu rdnawere targeted and quantified
from protistan community samples collected in the ross sea during the austral summer of we used three
standards of different length and optimized conditions to obtain accurate quantitative retrieval across the range
of expected amplicon sizes a necessary criterion for analyzing taxonomically diverse s rdna molecules from
natural environments the ability to concurrently identify and quantify microorganisms in their natural environ 
ment makes qsmrt a powerful rapid and cost effective approach for defining ecosystem diversity and function

 introduction

the enumeration and classification of organisms in the environment
is crucial for our understanding of ecosystem structure and function 
over the past two decades advances in genomic technologies have rev 
olutionized our abilities to characterize microbial communities previ 
ously s and s ribosomal gene cloning and sanger sequencing
 sanger et al were used to discover representatives of many un 
cultured clades from environmental libraries revealing extensive bacte 
rial and eukaryotic diversity e g giovannoni et al pace 
lopez garcia et al moon van der staay et al rappé and
giovannoni second generation sequencing techniques such as
 pyrosequencing margulies et al illumina sequencing
 bentley et al and ion torrent rothberg et al have
since yielded sequence data from environmental microbial communi 
ties on an unprecedented scale e g sogin et al gilbert and
dupont it is now possible to generate millions of sequences
fromhundreds of samples e g de vargas et al giving us insights
into the cosmopolitan nature of microbial communities and their di 
verse functions worden et al 

despite our newfound ability to rapidly characterizemicrobial com 
munities it is still surprisingly difficult to obtain highly resolved abun 
dance information for many groups of organisms in the marine

environment for example hplc data on photosynthetic pigments can
only provide broad phylogenetic resolution additionally chlorophyll 
based enumeration techniques are often inappropriate because chloro 
phyll content does not always reflect biomass concentration geider 
 halsey and jones culture based methods are often not
suitable because most microbes are not amendable to laboratory
cultivation staley and konopka flow cytometry has been used
to address fundamental questions regarding the abundance and distri 
bution of microbial communities legendre et al but autofluo 
rescence and side scatter cannot finely resolve taxa microscopic
enumeration is time consuming and challenging considering most
prokaryotes and many protists can only be discriminated by cellular
characteristics that often are non distinct with standard bright field
microscopy simon et al massana likewise automated
imaging systems e g flow cytobot olson et al imaging flow
cytobot olson and sosik provide excellent opportunities for in
situ imaging and enumeration but many phytoplankton species 
particularly picoeukaryotes are cryptic and difficult to solely identify
using image based analyses fluorescent probes amann et al 
and q pcr based techniques e g howard et al have been used
to revealfine scalemicrobial population dynamics but are not amenable
to high throughput studies and require a priori knowledge of nucleotide
sequences 

understanding species abundance is fundamental to constrain rate 
based measurements assisting interpretations of carbon sequestration
and the flow of energy through ecosystems quantification of microbial
communities using high throughput sequencing techniques would pro 
vide a rapid and powerful approach for enumeration coupling abundance

following quantification all samples were standardized to the same

each smrt cell required μg of dna for sequencing since we were
duplexing μg of amplicons were therefore required from each sam

 × amplicons would be needed for each duplexed sequencing

we stress that there is active discussion in the literature regarding
how to analyze smrt cell data e g schloss et al since
the purpose of this paper was to develop a quantification approach
rather than technically assess the merits of the sequencing chemistry 
we have followed a standard protocol for sequence curation 

sequences containing homopolymers n nucleotides long were
removed and any sequences n bp were eliminated to disregard
concatamers sometimes produced during smrt bell formation fichot
and norman we note that schloss et al also established a
curation procedure to cull repeats that were or more nucleotides in
length which reduced overall experiment wide error in s rrna genes
sequenced using the smrt platform following homopolymer removal 
sequences were aligned against a silva based reference alignment

the resulting alignment was screened to exclude sequences b bp re 
maining sequences that differed by b bp were pre clustered using the

the multiple pass coverage obtained by ccs and the low chimera detec

the next order designation with ≥ homology was given 

an exogenous retrieval conversion factor yeastcf was determined
by dividing the number of sequences of yeast standard added to the pcr

mean length of bp and were – bp libraries contained
between and bioinformatically retrievable reads before
the removal of metazoa and fungi because samples were duplexed 
we expected that we would obtain reads from each sample if
each zero mode wavelength zmw in a smrt cell led to a sequence
that was suitable for downstream bioinformatic analysis since only
 of potential reads were removed due to poor fastq sequence
quality most of the low sequence retrieval was likely due to unsuccess 
ful zmw occupation 

we hereafter describe data derived from five libraries stations 
 pennell bank shelf break joides basin north pennell
bank and mawson bank these five libraries yielded reads
that were binned into otus at identity yielding protistan
otus our sequences were obtained using the older c c chemistry
compared to the newer sequencing chemistry used in later studies e g 
mosher et al schloss et al wagner et al but
despite this potential shortcoming of our top otus are identical
to ross sea clonal sequences present in the ncbi nr database 

overall data indicate that themicrobial eukaryotic communities of the
ross sea were not particularly diverse during late january–february
 this finding is consistent with other seasonal observations from
this region sedwick et al sedwick et al olson et al 
 singletons formed otus similar to the value of 
that was recently obtained during smrt cell sequencing of s rrna
gene amplicons franzén et al in our dataset only otus
were represented by n reads for each sample only copies of
 s rdnawere used to generate amplicons and not all zmwswere occu 
pied so it remains to be seen if community coverage was optimal we
also did not conduct mock community analysis to obtain error rates for
our sequencing runs nor assess reproducibility this omission may
suggest that our diversity estimates are not well constrained however 
replicate incubation experiments exhibited exceptional similarity in the
relative abundance of otus kustka et al for example the coeffi 
cient of variation for moderately abundant otus above collected
from replicate treatments averaged ± kustka et al

 quantitative smrt cell sequencing qsmrt and its application to
describe ross sea communities

high throughput sequencing has provided an unparalleled opportu 
nity to describemicrobial communities but quantification has remained
a challenge quantitative smrt cell sequencing qsmrt is a significant
step towards this goal enabling the simultaneous identification and
quantification of environmental amplicons application of the qsmrt
approach to the v – region of s ssu rdna was highly reproducible 
the mean percentage ± se of reads from each of three spiked stan 
dards sp sc and spmod was ± ± and ±
 respectively consistent with the addition of each standard
prior to pcr amplification and sequencing one wayanova analysis in 
dicated that therewas no significant difference in the proportions of any
of the three sequences p since the standards varied in length
 – bp this contrasts with previous reports of size selectivity
during smrt cell sequencing fichot and norman 

quantitative smrt sequencing was used to investigate the distribu 
tion and dynamics of protistans present in the ross sea during the aus 
tral summer of quantification data for the most numerically
dominant otus obtained during this study are given in supplemental
data s the overwhelming majority of s rdna molecules isolated
from this regionwere derived from bacillariophytes fig confirming
microscopic and biogeochemical evidence over of the copies of s
rdna observed in this study were derived from otu an unknown
bacillariophyta this otu comprised of the copies frommawson
bank where it was present at × copies ml− fig mawson
bank is a highly turbulent area with a deepmixed layer depth kohut et
al so this could suggest a preference for the resulting physical
and chemical features generated by this topographic feature since the
closest matches to otu exhibited only sequence homology to
chaetoceros sp it is tempting to describe this identification as an en 
demic species the possibility that the ross sea has a diverse range of
endemic protistan communities was previously suggested by gast et
al who applied denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to

ing is known about the biogeochemical roles or ecological controls of
this silicifying mixotrophic genus 

to further explore the distribution of eukaryote microbes in the
sampled region nmds analyses were conducted using the qsmrt de 
rived data a diverse taxonomic range of protistan otus were observed
to drive ordinances and exhibit differential distribution patterns fig 
associated otus could represent groups of protists transiently
inhabiting the same body of water they could also represent associa 
tions between microzooplankton grazers and phytoplankton e g cili 
ates and diatoms at pennell bank or other lifestyles and interactions 
such as parasitism e g syndiniales paulsenella and related communi 
ties a large number of otus n drove ordinances towards pen 
nell bank indicating that a diverse and unique protistan community
was associatedwithwaters above this topographic feature this concurs
with observations that pennell bank is both physically and chemically
distinct from the other locations studied with a sedimentary source of
iron and shallow mixed layer depth kohut et al 

 advantages of the qsmrt approach and future directions for research

standard based methods have been attempted for some second
generation sequencing technologies gifford et al jiang et al 
 however to our knowledge this is the first to attempt quantita 
tive sequencing using the smrt platform the identification and quan 
tification of protists was more highly resolved than flow cytometry
fig biplot showing significant drivers of the nmds ordinance calculated using qsmrt corre
given in supplemental data s 
allows more rapid than microscopy and culture independent quanti 
tative smrt methods enabled substantially more identifications than
targeted genomic techniques such as qpcr or nucleic acid probes 
which require species or genus specific optimizations we applied
qsmrt to eukaryote ribosomal dna which enabled an easy and concur 
rent way to analyze phytoplankton and microzooplankton populations 
however this method could easily be applied to bacterial or archaeal
samples sequencing using the smrt platform is rapid and it only
costs to sequence a single smrt cell as of january use of
the new pacific biosciences sequel system that enables seven times
more reads for each smrt cell could substantially increase qsmrt
coverage therefore qsmrt has the potential to become a universally
effective rapid and low cost quantification technique contributing to 
wards a numerical understanding of themicrobial species that underpin
biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem function 

an advantage of the smrt platform is that substantially longer reads
can be obtained in comparison to any illumina based platform we only
targeted the v – regions of s ribosomal dna because variability in
amplification efficiency increases with larger amplicon size kleter et
al bustin however given appropriate testing it is still
possible that full length ribosomal sequences could be amplified and
subjected to qsmrt sequencing to enable more accurate identifications
 singer et al coupled with the use of newer chemistries that
generate ribosomal sequence data of comparable quality to reads ob 
tained using the or miseq platforms schloss et al wagner
et al finer scale taxonomic qsmrt identifications are an exciting
possibility 

quantitative smrt is designed to enumerate s rdna copy number
but additional steps would be required to obtain cell concentrations 
many marine protists have multiple copies of rdna within their ge 
nomes and the problem of copy number bias is common to all methods
of eukaryote ribosomal gene sequencing reported copy numbers of
rrna genes in dinoflagellates range from – per cell
 galluzzi et al godhe et al while diatoms may contain
b zhu et al to n copies of rdna per cell godhe et
al some ciliates may possess up to copies per cell
cted reads numbers in parentheses represent otus identifications for groups a and b are



 b m jones a b kustka journal of microbiological methods – 
 gong et al ribosomal dna copy number data are lacking for
mostmarine protists and are clearly needed to enable amore robust un 
derstanding of microbial ecosystem structure for example our data for
laackmaniella otu leads to very high and somewhat unrealistic in
situ concentrations × individuals l− supplemental data s 
but if individuals from this otu had a similar number of s rrna
genes per cell as the related genera tintinnopsis × cell− 
gong et al a more realistic value of individuals l− would be
obtained we note that when strictly confining observations to phyto 
plankton and smaller protists differences in otu copy number per cell
may be less important because rdna copy number appears to be corre 
lated with biovolume godhe et al for example an otu with
similarity to mast b stramenopiles was prevalent over mb at a
concentration of copies of s ssu rdna·ml− epifluorescent mi 
croscopy following fish labeling has indicated that this group is univer 
sally distributed at a maximum density of cells ml− massana et
al congruence of these values further validates the approach
of qsmrt for enumeration of enigmatic marine protistan groups 

given the speed with which the field of sequencing has advanced it
should comeas no surprise that innovative platformswill continue to be
developed we suggest that the use of amplification free sequencing
technologies facilitate the accurate quantification of amplicons generat 
ed from environmental samples this is complemented by choices in ex 
perimental design such as ensuring that amplicons are generated
before a rate limiting stage of pcr by applying the qsmrt method to
environmental protistan samples we show that it is now possible to
identify and quantify hundreds of ribosomal amplicons derived from
microbial communities as more information becomes available about
ribosomal copy number the direct quantification of cell number from
sequencing data should soon be possible
