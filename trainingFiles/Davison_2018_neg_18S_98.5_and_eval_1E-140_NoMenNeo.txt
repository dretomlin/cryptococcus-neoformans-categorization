abstract
island biogeography theory is one of the most influential paradigms in ecology that island characteristics including
remoteness can profoundly modulate biological diversity has been borne out by studies of animals and plants by contrast 
the processes influencing microbial diversity in island systems remain largely undetermined we sequenced arbuscular
mycorrhizal am fungal dna from plant roots collected on islands worldwide and compared am fungal diversity on
islands with existing data from mainland sites am fungal communities on islands even those km from the closest
mainland comprised few endemic taxa and were as diverse as mainland communities thus in contrast to patterns recorded
among macro organisms efficient dispersal appears to outweigh the effects of taxogenesis and extinction in regulating am
fungal diversity on islands nonetheless am fungal communities on more distant islands comprised a higher proportion of
previously cultured and large spored taxa indicating that dispersal may be human mediated or require tolerance of
significant environmental stress such as exposure to sunlight or high salinity the processes driving large scale patterns of
microbial diversity are a key consideration for attempts to conserve and restore functioning ecosystems in this era of rapid
global change 

introduction

islands have figured prominently in the development of
ecological theory e g – with their theory of island
biogeography macarthur and wilson argued that the
equilibrium number of species inhabiting an island or other
isolated habitat patch is determined by the balance between
immigration and speciation on one hand and emigration and
extinction on the other they also suggested that island
characteristics—notably the size of an island and its remo 
teness from potential source communities i e mainlands 
—modulate the importance of these processes such that a
positive species–area relationship leads to higher species
richness on large islands while a negative species–isolation
relationship results in lower richness on remote islands 
descriptive and rarely experimental studies have lent
empirical support to the theory and have confirmed both
species–area and species–isolation relationships the
theory has become one of the most influential ecological
paradigms and is central to several applied e g con 
servation ecology and theoretical e g metapopulation and

metacommunity theories disciplines moreover the
study of island systems continues to provide new insights
into a range of ecological questions including those related
to the process of community assembly 

most empirical tests of island biogeography theory have
focused on animals or plants and attempts to understand
equivalent processes acting on micro organisms have
mainly studied habitat fragmentation at the landscape level
or below – despite notable work on certain taxonomic
groups e g fungi information about the large scale
biogeography of micro organisms is lacking one
group of micro organisms whose global biogeography has
been relatively well characterised is the arbuscular mycor 
rhizal am fungi am fungi subphylum glo 
meromycotina live in association with the roots of
about of terrestrial plant species gaining plant 
assimilated carbon while supplying their hosts with nutri 
ents mainly p and resistance to abiotic stress and patho 
gens at small scales the diversity patterns of these
essential plant symbionts are influenced by both niche and
neutral processes including some degree of dis 
persal limitation i e an inability of taxa to reach potentially
suitable habitats in a given time frame nonetheless 
am fungi are found on all continents and many approxi 
mately species level phylogroups phylogenetically defined
groupings of taxa described by dna sequences have been
shown to exhibit wide distributions frequently spanning
multiple continents am fungi are soil dwelling
organisms and may disperse using spores or by transport of
hyphal or colonised root fragments limited evidence
exists for a number of potential dispersal vectors including
wind invertebrates mammals birds and
water but the relative importance of each remains
unquantified it is even unclear whether the wide distribu 
tions of am fungal taxa are the result of incremental small 
scale movement or long distance dispersal events 

evidence from plants indicates that taxon arrival and
persistence on isolated islands is correlated with aspects of
life history such as the traits influencing propagule pro 
duction dispersal and establishment though see ref 
 for example pteridophytes—a group of wind 
dispersed plants with very small diaspores—are randomly
distributed throughout the galápagos islands while the
distributions of comparatively larger seeded plants are
correlated with island size and isolation within the archi 
pelago by contrast assigning life history char 
acteristics to micro organisms in environmental samples
remains extremely challenging though metagenomic stu 
dies represent a promising avenue and there have
been few attempts to connect micro organism life history
and biogeography – 

some am fungal taxa produce spores but dna based
surveys of environmental samples have revealed a

significant proportion of am fungal diversity that does not
correspond to known sporulating taxa while some
taxa known only from environmental dna may yet be
shown to produce spores abundantly sporulating and
easily cultured taxa hereafter ‘cultured’ are presumed to
be relatively efficient dispersers and have been broadly
characterised as ruderals i e tolerant of disturbance 
 among such taxa certain spore characteristics can
also be used to infer a more detailed life history strategy
 e g spore size this means that a small number of
life history characteristics are available for a fraction
of recorded am fungal diversity but that alternative
traits and methods e g dna based are required for a
complete survey of naturally occurring am fungal
communities 

all else being equal smaller fungal propagules are more
efficiently transported by wind therefore if wind
is an important dispersal vector for am fungi one might
expect cultured i e known to be spore producing and
specifically small spored am fungal taxa to predominate on
islands conversely among vascular plants and other fungi 
large propagules are associated with establishment success
in harsh conditions this may equally apply to am
fungal spores for instance large spored gigaspora are
capable of multiple germinations and such spores stay
viable for several years and through changing environ 
mental conditions in addition vascular plants may
arrive at islands via floating in seawater in which
case the plant propagules are often relatively large if
transport in seawater or other long distance dispersal
mechanisms that impose significant stress are important for
am fungi large spored cultured taxa might be expected to
predominate on islands finally the origin of fungal pro 
pagules may be an important determinant of island am
fungal life history characteristics human mediated trans 
port might favour cultured taxa since these are known to be
associated with anthropogenic habitats 

we sampled am fungal communities on oceanic islands
worldwide allowing us to test hypotheses related to am
fungal biogeography and dispersal we predicted that diver 
sity or trait responses to island conditions should be most
apparent on small or isolated islands reflecting species–area
and species–isolation relationships furthermore we expected
that the effects of isolation on the prevalence of culturable
taxa and spore size estimates in am fungal communities
should provide evidence about the dispersal characteristics of
am fungi if am fungal dispersal is largely conducted
through incremental small scale dispersal events then island
isolation should represent a significant barrier to dispersal and
consequently island community composition should be sto 
chastic and characterised by lower diversity and greater
endemism than mainland communities conversely if am
fungi are efficient long distance dispersers then the taxon

 j davison et al 



pools capable of colonising island and mainland communities
should be similar and endemism should not be particularly
pronounced on islands if small spored taxa predominate on
islands this might indicate an important role of wind dis 
persal however if large spored taxa predominate it might
indicate a dispersal or establishment route that requires sig 
nificant stress tolerance e g seawater transport equally a
predominance of cultured am fungal taxa on islands might
indicate that human mediated transport plays a role 

materials and methods

sampling island am fungal communities

we collected samples from islands worldwide in the
arctic ocean svalbard baltic sea Öland and saaremaa 
caribbean guadeloupe pacific ocean new caledonia 
tikehau tahiti tasman sea tasmania atlantic ocean
 iceland sal santiago and mediterranean sea mallorca 
crete fig supplementary methods and supplementary
table s all islands besides mallorca tasmania and
possibly new caledonia were of oceanic i e volcanic 
origin or were submerged following isolation from a con 
tinental mainland supplementary methods this means
that vicariance was not a factor in the formation of most of
the island am fungal communities under investigation 
rather taxa must have colonised following island formation 
we compared island data with an existing global mainland

data set collected and analysed in an identical manner by
davison et al 

on each island we identified one or two sites in the locally
present ecosystems that were least disturbed by human
activities following the design used by davison et al 
we sampled two plots at each study site representing visually
homogeneous vegetation and habitat conditions the plots
were approximately × m and the distance between plots
generally ranged between several hundreds of metres and
several km in each plot we generally selected four locally
abundant am plant species and excavated four randomly
chosen individuals of each plant species supplementary
table s however fewer species were sampled on tikehau
and tahiti and in these cases more individuals up to per
species were sampled supplementary table s soil and
other material adhering to plant roots was carefully removed
by hand a root sample of approximately cm was wrapped
in tissue paper and placed in a plastic bag containing silica
gel a pooled topsoil sample approximately g com 
prising individual samples was collected from all plots
except tasmania for details of soil chemical analyses and
other recorded environmental variables see supplementary
methods and table s 

molecular methods and bioinformatics

we followed the molecular methods and bioinformatics
used by davison et al a full description of these
methods is presented in the supplementary methods

briefly we amplified am fungal dna partial ssu rrna
gene from root samples and subjected this to high 
throughput sequencing we used blast to
match i the obtained ‘island’ sequence reads and ii the
‘mainland’ sequencing reads from davison et al 
against known virtual taxa vt i e phylogroups from the
maarjam database supplementary table s using
the same classification criteria used to define vt in maar 
jam we then searched for previously unrecorded vt
among the reads not matching an existing vt supple 
mentary table s we used the maarjam database to
identify those vt that could be associated with an am
fungal morphospecies i e species described on the basis of
spore traits from a cultured organism supplementary
table s vt were defined as ‘cultured’ if they contained
sequences derived from an isolate of known morphospecies
identity for cultured vt we estimated a mean spore dia 
meter based on the spore characteristics of component
morphospecies supplementary table s finally we
coestimated evolutionary timescale and phylogeny for all
known vt using beast the phylogeny vt 
morphospecies associations and spore diameter estimates
are shown on fig sequencing data generated in this
study have been submitted to embl study accession
prjeb this includes raw sequencing reads from all
runs and a set of representative sequences matched against
different vt where available two sequences per vt from
each host plant in each plot accessions
lt –lt sequencing data from davison
et al used for reanalysis in this study are also available
from embl study accession prjeb 

statistical analysis

we primarily focused on am fungal diversity and life history
characteristics derived from taxon lists i e 
presence–absence since the predictions of island biogeo 
graphy theory mainly relate to the distribution rather than
abundance of organisms however since organism abun 
dance is expected to influence the functional properties of
communities and ecosystems we included several ana 
logous approaches incorporating the relative abundance of vt
in samples estimated from the relative abundance of
sequencing reads we expected these parallel analyses to
provide an indication of whether island biogeographic pro 
cesses were reflected by ecologically relevant changes in
community assembly 

for each island and mainland site we estimated local
endemism by calculating the number of vt that were
recorded at the site and nowhere else we also calculated
an index of vt distribution for each site the mean
number of other sites globally occupied by the vt
present 

for further analysis of am fungal communities on
islands and in the mainland set we pooled the replicates
within each host plant species per plot based on these
plant species level community estimates hereafter referred
to as samples we investigated community diversity 
composition and trait characteristics using two modelling
approaches i island biogeography models ib only
containing the explanatory variables ‘set’ island vs main 
land set or ‘island area’ and ‘island remoteness’ and ii 
island biogeography and environment models ibe which
in addition to ib variables incorporated all available
explanatory variables related to soil chemistry ph n p 
altitude and climate mean annual precipitation map 
mean annual temperature mat the purpose of the ibe
models was to test the importance of island biogeographic
processes after accounting for measured environmental
differences among island and mainland samples in all
analyses besides those describing multivariate community
composition the variable ‘island remoteness’ was calcu 
lated as the haversine distance accounting for the curvature
of the earth separating each island from the closest con 
tinental coastline in analyses of composition each island
site was paired with the closest measured mainland site
 from and in these cases geographic separation was
calculated as the haversine distance separating the paired
sites this measure was highly correlated with the distance
of each island from the closest continent pearson’s r 
 p though the rank order of islands changed 

we used permanova function adonis from r
package vegan with sørensen abundance unweigh 
ted and bray curtis abundance weighted distance to
estimate compositional differences between island and
mainland samples we also calculated mean pairwise dis 
tances between samples from each island and a paired
mainland site the geographically closest mainland site to
each island supplementary figure s these distances
were regressed against island area and the geographic dis 
tance separating each island from its paired site to place
the effect of geographic separation on compositional dis 
tance in the context of compositional decay over continental
land masses we also included data points corresponding to
all pairwise distances compositional and geographic 
between mainland sites within individual continents in the
geographic distance analysis we visualised community
composition using non metric multidimensional scaling

for all island and mainland samples we calculated vt
richness and two diversity estimators that incorporate
organism abundance the asymptotic estimators for expo 
nential shannon and reciprocal simpson diversity we
did not generate an extrapolated estimate of richness

discussion

here we report a first attempt to measure oceanic island
biogeographic patterns in a group of microbial organisms 
plant symbiotic am fungi we recorded only very minor
compositional differences between island and mainland
fungal communities and found no evidence of high ende 
mism on islands or significant differences between main 
land and island fungal communities in terms of diversity or
characteristics reflecting taxonomy and life history fur 
thermore neither island remoteness nor island area sig 
nificantly explained am fungal diversity these results
indicate that isolation does not perceivably restrict immi 
gration or promote endemism as a result of taxogenesis in
island compared with mainland communities and suggest
that long distance dispersal might be effective within this
group of organisms such a pattern deviates considerably
from those typically recorded among macroscopic organ 
isms nonetheless we found that compositional dis 
tances between am fungal communities on islands and
paired mainland sites exceeded those observed between
mainland sites of equivalent geographic separation fur 
thermore island remoteness was associated with certain
taxonomic and life history characteristics that provide clues
about am fungal dispersal and establishment on distant
islands 

few endemic taxa among island am fungal
communities

some case studies have identified previously unrecorded
am fungal phylogroups or morphospecies from island

systems measuring endemism is however con 
tingent on the availability of comparative global data while
interpretation is also shaped by the taxonomic resolution of
observations see the supplementary methods for a
discussion of vt resolution using the most comprehen 
sive available comparative data set we discovered six
previously unrecorded am fungal vt in this analysis but
only one was endemic to a single island present at both
sites on tikehau an atoll in french polynesia in the south
pacific ocean furthermore all taxa that were recorded
from a single island site in this analysis had previously been
reported from mainland or other island locations as indi 
cated by their presence in the maarjam database our
sampling approach may have overlooked endemic taxa in
unsampled areas of study islands or indeed in sampling
plots if the taxa were present at low abundance none 
theless the apparent lack of endemism in island commu 
nities—even large or isolated island communities—strongly
suggests that the contribution to island diversity of in situ
taxogenesis at the level of vt is low compared with that
of immigration furthermore the fact that taxonomic
diversity was similar at island and mainland sites indicates
that strong immigration is not significantly outweighed by
local extinctions on islands 

our inference that long distance dispersal of am fungal
vt is relatively efficient compared with that of many
animal and plant species is not entirely unexpected a
global survey of mainland am fungal communities indi 
cated that many am fungal vt have distribution areas
encompassing multiple continents with vt lists exhibiting
low turnover at large spatial scales furthermore recent
genetic evidence has shown that individual genotypes

within the rhizophagus irregularis species group are pre 
sent on multiple continents the diversity and com 
position of local am fungal communities on distant oceanic
islands presented in this study suggest that the wide dis 
tribution of am fungal vt cannot be explained solely by
incremental small scale dispersal events i e in soil 
rather long distance dispersal must explain am fungal
presence on islands and the apparent magnitude of immi 
gration relative to taxogenesis and local extinction suggests
that dispersal is relatively efficient rather than occasional 

island remoteness favours certain life history
characteristics

am fungal communities on distant islands were char 
acterised by relatively high phylogenetic diversity and
comprised relatively more spore forming cultured taxa and
taxa from outside of the order glomerales even once the
environmental characteristics of islands were accounted for 
we also found that islands generally harboured somewhat
less well distributed taxa in terms of the total number of
sites occupied compared with mainland sites suggesting
that the traits allowing taxa to establish on islands do not
confer a generally widespread distribution furthermore 
among cultured taxa we recorded relatively more large 
spored am fungal taxa on distant islands on one hand a
predominance of large spored taxa may indicate that the
germination and establishment phases are critical stages in
the survival of am fungal spores reaching distant islands 
irrespective of the mode of dispersal there is some evi 
dence that large spored fungi are characterised by high
germinability and establishment and predominate
under resource limitation but information about the
significance of spore size for am fungal establishment is
limited also it is unclear why the harshness of the
local environment should increase with island remoteness 
however in support of this interpretation the effect of
island remoteness on mean spore diameter was apparent in
the ib model but not in the ibe model where measured
environmental variables were accounted for on the other
hand large spores may indicate that conditions during the
dispersal process require a high degree of stress tolerance 
in the context of dispersal to distant oceanic islands 
transport by seawater appears a plausible dispersal
mechanism as am fungal spores maintain germinability
after storage in seawater though they vary in their
tolerance of salinity among plants larger diaspores
tend to be better able to survive transport in seawater 
analysis of seawater currents suggests that microbial pro 
pagules might take less than years to be transported
between any two oceanic locations globally such a
timescale suggests that transport in seawater is a process
potentially capable of producing the cosmopolitan patternsta

microbial island biogeography isolation shapes the life history characteristics but not diversity of 



observed in this organism group while at the same time
highlighting the potential benefit of a stress tolerant dis 
persal strategy though am fungal sequences have been
detected from ocean water direct empirical evidence
with respect to transport of fungal spores in seawater is
lacking 

an alternative explanation for the high diversity of island
am fungal communities and for some of the characteristics
exhibited by am fungal communities on distant islands is

that they reflect the role of human mediated transport 
human activities are believed to have transported some am
fungi over long distances although the actual means
and rates of human mediated dispersal are not known 
humans may preferentially facilitate dispersal of cultured
taxa simply because these occur disproportionately in dis 
turbed systems including agricultural settings and
produce relatively abundant propagules though not
directly recorded human transport is believed to have led
highly similar genetic lineages of another soil organism
group collembola to occur on several continental land 
masses and remote islands worldwide 

we recorded relatively more non glomerales taxa and
greater phylogenetic diversity on distant islands case stu 
dies have suggested that disturbed habitats tend to be
characterised by a relatively low proportion of glomeraceae
 which may again reflect favouring of stress tolerance 
however these results and evidence from elsewhere 
 demonstrate that trait–environment relationships
must be considered in light of the phylogenetic con 
servatism in traits considered for analysis in this analysis 
cultured vt are more likely to belong to non glomerales
clades and spore size is also conserved at a lower taxonomic
level within the cultured set such patterns mean that
observed trait–environment relationships might be a proxy
for responses attributable to other conserved traits 

area effects may operate at smaller scales

recorded am fungal community characteristics did not
vary as much in relation to island area as they did in relation
to island remoteness a similarly weak effect of area has
been reported at a smaller scale from remnant forest patches
in an agricultural landscape we see multiple reasons
why island area was generally not associated with char 
acteristics of am fungal communities first it is possible
that our measures of local diversity did not adequately
capture particular island biogeographic processes for
instance a measure of whole island gamma diversity might
be more sensitive to processes immigration taxogenesis 
extinction that define island taxon pools but which are
modulated by local conditions in determining the alpha
diversity of samples second island area is expected to
determine the rate of stochastic local extinction our
results might therefore indicate that either island diversity is
not importantly limited by extinction or that this process
operates at a scale below the range of island sizes in our
study e g well below km a related point to note is that
our study incorporated a relatively small number of islands
located over a vast area essentially global by collecting a
geographically widespread set of samples we were able to
conduct a general test of the effects of isolation per se 
however this generality may have come at the expense of

fig mean compositional distance sørensen between root 
associated am fungal communities as a function of the geographic

 j davison et al 



some power to detect relationships between diversity and
island characteristics compared with studying multiple
islands in a single archipelago while we accounted for
important environmental variables in our analyses it is to be
expected that the variable physical climatic and biogeo 
graphic context of such a widespread set of islands 
introduces noise into area–diversity and isolation–diversity
relationships for similar reasons a degree of caution must
be exercised when interpreting the relationships we identi 
fied since our explanatory variables island vs mainland 
island area island remoteness could have been confounded
with other unmeasured variables 

covariation in mutualist responses to isolation 

different am fungal communities are known to differen 
tially affect plant performance and there is evi 
dence of differences in effect between glomerales vs non 

glomerales am fungal taxa and between taxa characterised
as cultured vs uncultured or large vs small spored 
 equally the presence and density of suitable host
plants may limit the establishment of certain am fungal
taxa passenger hypothesis thus it is possible that
the dispersal characteristics of either symbiont community
have shaped the functional attributes of both plant and am
fungal communities on islands our results suggest that
dispersal limitation of am fungi to distant islands is likely
to be slight overall so it is perhaps more plausible that
over representation of ruderal plant species with small
propagules efficient dispersers has favoured the estab 
lishment of ruderal large spored efficient disperser am
fungal taxa on islands nonetheless if am fungal taxa
represent the more efficient group of dispersers the early
and efficient arrival of ruderal am fungal taxa to islands
may have had an effect on colonising plants in the past
 driver hypothesis

microbial island biogeography isolation shapes the life history characteristics but not diversity of 



conclusion

our results provide a first indication of the oceanic island
biogeographic processes influencing a microbial organism
group the island biogeography of am fungi is char 
acterised by efficient dispersal outweighing potential effects
of endemism and extinction nonetheless we found that
remote island am fungal communities are functionally
distinct due to their high phylogenetic diversity and relative
predominance of cultured taxa from non glomerales clades
and those exhibiting relatively large spores these char 
acteristics suggest that stress tolerance is an important trait
that either reflects the origin of colonising taxa e g 
anthropogenic systems or facilitates dispersal and estab 
lishment in the abiotic and biotic conditions associated with
island systems

	microbial island biogeography isolation shapes the life history characteristics but not diversity of root symbiotic fungal communities
	abstract
	introduction
	materials and methods
	sampling island am fungal communities
	molecular methods and bioinformatics
	statistical analysis

	results
	taxon distribution and endemism
	island vs mainland communities
	island remoteness and size

	discussion
	few endemic taxa among island am fungal communities
	island remoteness favours certain life history characteristics
	area effects may operate at smaller scales
	covariation in mutualist responses to isolation 

	conclusion
	compliance with ethical standards
