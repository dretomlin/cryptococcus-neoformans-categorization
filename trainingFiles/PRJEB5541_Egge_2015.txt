abstract

microalgae in the division haptophyta may be difficult to identify to species by

microscopy because they are small and fragile here we used high throughput

sequencing to explore the diversity of haptophytes in outer oslofjorden skag 

errak and supplemented this with electron microscopy nano and picoplank 

tonic subsurface samples were collected monthly for yr and the haptophytes

were targeted by amplification of rna cdna with haptophyta specific s ribo 

somal dna v primers pyrosequencing revealed higher species richness of ha 

ptophytes than previously observed in the skagerrak by microscopy from ca 

 reads we obtained haptophyte operational taxonomic units otus 

after rigorous filtering and clustering the majority of the otus

matched environmental sequences not linked to a morphological species most

of which were affiliated with the order prymnesiales phylogenetic analyses

including oslofjorden otus and available cultured and environmental hapto 

phyte sequences showed that several of the otus matched sequences form 

ing deep branching lineages potentially representing novel haptophyte classes 

pyrosequencing also retrieved cultured species not previously reported by

microscopy in the skagerrak electron microscopy revealed species not yet

genetically characterised and some potentially novel taxa this study contrib 

utes to linking genotype to phenotype within this ubiquitous and ecologically

important protist group and reveals great unknown diversity 

marine haptophytes occur in all seas as major compo 

nents of the pico and nanoplankton and carry out key pro 

cesses in global biogeochemical cycles besides playing

an important role as primary producers andersen 

jardillier et al thomsen et al haptophyte

species display a wide range of additional ecological func 

tions both mixotrophic as well as some heterotrophic

species exist jones et al kawachi et al and

haptophytes are important bacterial grazers in the ocean

 havskum and riemann unrein et al some

haptophytes occur in symbiotic relationships either with

other protists e g decelle et al or cyanobacteria

 thompson et al bloom forming haptophytes may

have large ecological and economical impact species

within the genera prymnesium and chrysochromulina in

particular p parvum and p polylepis may form toxic

blooms that can be harmful to marine biota and farmed

fish gran�eli et al blooms of the colony forming
phaeocystis species p pouchetii p globosa and p ant 

arctica may affect fisheries and tourism through the pro 

duction of scum and acrylic acid edvardsen and imai

 schoemann et al phaeocystis spp together

with the calcifying haptophytes coccolithophores are

also major producers of dimethylsulphoniopropionate and

thus play an important role in the global sulphur cycle

 edvardsen and imai malin and steinke 

furthermore the production of calcified scales coccoliths 

in the coccolithophores has a major impact on the earth’s

carbon balance de vargas et al 

despite the ecological importance of the haptophytes 

knowledge on their species biodiversity is limited due to

small cell size and morphological similarity identification

molecular biological methods especially among the non

lose appendages and scales essential for morphological

identification jensen b kuylenstierna and karlson

 about species of haptophytes have been

described morphologically jordan et al and from

ca of these the s rdna gene sequence is available

 the protist ribosomal reference database per feb 

guillou et al which is currently the most commonly

sequenced marker for haptophytes however investiga 

tions of environmental water samples using molecular

methods have revealed a large diversity of novel hapto 

phyte sequences which suggests that the total number of

species is much higher particularly among the pico hapto 

phytes bittner et al cuvelier et al liu et al 

 moon van der staay et al simon et al 

currently ca unique full length or partial s rdna

haptophyte sequences are included in the pr database

 guillou et al some of the environmental

sequences may represent novel deep branching hapto 

phyte lineages for instance clade d sensu edvardsen

et al consists entirely of environmental sequences

 moon van der staay et al and is sufficiently genet 

ically divergent to be recognised as a separate order of

haptophytes once the morphology of these taxa is known

 edvardsen et al a third class of haptophytes has

been proposed based exclusively on molecular data shi

et al termed hap by shalchian tabrizi et al 

 and recently simon et al recovered yet

another deep branching lineage termed hap 

in the skagerrak the sea separating norway and den 

mark fig s a massive toxic bloom of prymnesium

polylepis previously chrysochromulina polylepis in 

had detrimental consequences for benthic organisms and

farmed fish dahl et al lekve et al rosen 

berg et al this bloom prompted electron micros 

copy investigations of the diversity of the order

prymnesiales in scandinavian waters eikrem in

particular “chrysochromulina sensu lato” e g jensen

 a here taken to mean species originally assigned to

the genus chrysochromulina but now divided into five

genera based on both molecular data and morphology

 edvardsen et al the bloom was also a driving

force for isolation of cultures morphological and molecular

characterisation of strains and phylogenetic inference 

resulting in descriptions of new species and revised taxon 

omy edvardsen et al eikrem eikrem

and edvardsen eikrem and throndsen today 

these studies serve as a valuable reference for interpret 

ing high throughput sequencing hts data the major

advantage of hts methods is the sampling depth that can

be obtained and the potential to recover fragile and rare

species that may be missed with microscopy methods 

however current hts technology imposes an upper limit

on the length of the marker region of about – bp 
which to a certain extent limits the taxonomic resolution 

the variable v region of the s rdna is a widely used

molecular marker in surveys of protistan diversity in

general e g behnke et al dunthorn et al 

medlin et al stoeck et al and has also been

used to target haptophytes in particular shalchian tabrizi

et al calculation of sequence similarity across the

v region of selected haptophyte s rdna sequences

 described in the methods section shows that most spe 

cies of haptophytes can be distinguished based on the v 

except certain groups of closely related species consider 

ing recent discoveries of haptophyte richness using molec 

ular tools we expect the haptophyte community in

skagerrak to be more diverse than what was inferred from

the earlier microscopy surveys 

the skagerrak and outer oslofjorden are characterised

by strong seasonal variation in meteorological and hydro 

logical conditions in particular light and temperature the

water masses are influenced by both saline atlantic and

brackish water currents the baltic current and runoff from

land resulting in highly variable salinity thus to recover

haptophyte species with different environmental prefer 

ences we included samples from all times of the year 

we sampled subsurface seawater from the outer oslofjor 

den monthly for yr and isolated rna to target cells that

were alive and active at the time of sampling and to avoid

extracellular dna from dead cells e g not et al 

the haptophytes were targeted by amplification of the var 

iable v region of the s rrna with haptophyte specific

primers previously described in egge et al in addi 

tion to the samples for sequencing we also collected and

analysed samples for electron microscopy the seasonal

dynamics of the haptophyte community will be presented

in a following paper 

in this work we aimed at describing the diversity of ha 

ptophytes in the skagerrak by pyrosequencing and

supplement this with electron microscopy we addressed

the following main questions what is the otu and spe 

cies richness and taxonomic composition of haptophytes

in the skagerrak how does the diversity revealed by 

pyrosequencing compare to previous microscopical obser 

vations do we recover novel haptophyte lineages and

results and discussion

 pyrosequencing recovers unprecedented diversity
of haptophytes in skagerrak

the phytoplankton communities in the oslofjorden and

skagerrak have been studied by microscopy throughout

the th century especially larger nano and microplank 

ton dominated by diatoms and dinoflagellates which may

be identified under the light microscope e g hasle and

smayda most haptophytes are small and fragile

and can only be identified to higher taxonomic levels

under the light microscope phylum – genus and require
electron microscopy for certain species identification to

achieve the sampling depth and potentially high taxonomic

resolution that can be obtained with hts techniques we

did pyrosequencing of samples collected monthly for

 yr targeting the haptophytes with haptophyte specific

primers overall after rigorous cleaning of reads including

denoising with ampliconnoise of the total reads

 reads were assigned to haptophyta which con 

firms the specificity of the primer pair after clustering at

 similarity and removal of dubious reads as

described in the methods section we obtained 

unique otus table s the number each otu is given is

according to their normalised total read abundance where

otu had most reads the blast hits in ncbi nr of the

 most abundant otus are given in table 

as shown in the inferred phylogenetic trees and from

the blast results the phylogenetic diversity of the of

otus is impressive fig – table s all orders of hap 
tophyta were represented and within the order prymnesi 

ales all genera were represented prymnesiaceae and

chrysochromulinaceae were the most otu rich families

 table further we recovered a high diversity of novel

taxa out of the otus only had 
sequence similarity with a cultured and genetically charac 

terised species whereas the majority had better match

with environmental clones table s fig – the high 
est number of uncultured and genetically uncharacterised

taxa was affiliated with prymnesiaceae and chrysochrom 

ulinaceae table 

considering that the material examined by electron

microscopy was obtained from much smaller volumes of

water than what was processed for pyrosequencing the

aim here is not a direct comparison between hts and

electron microscopy methods rather we consider these

methods to give complementary information about the

haptophyte community thus the pyrosequencing results

are interpreted both in relation to the em images obtained

diversity of haptophytes revealed by pyrosequencing egge et al 



from the same samples and observations from previous

electron microscopy surveys 

from previous surveys of scandinavian waters alto 

gether morphological species of haptophytes have

been reported eikrem jensen a kuylenstierna

and karlson however currently the s rdna

sequence is available from only of these table s 

hts nevertheless reveals a higher species richness of ha 

ptophytes than previously reported from skagerrak of the

species previously reported with known s rdna

sequence eight were not recovered by sequencing

 table s conversely of the sequenced and morphologi 

cally described species we detected three had not previ 

ously been reported from the skagerrak interestingly two

of these were proportionally abundant otus phaeocystis

cordata otu and syracosphaera pulchra otu 

whereas the third was the freshwater species chrysoch 

romulina parva otu table s 

of the otus and otus were

found uniquely in the pico and nanoplanktonic size frac 

tions respectively table s of the otus found

uniquely in the nano size fraction most were affiliated with

coccolithophores or phaeocystales whereas the otus

found only in the pico size fraction were mostly affiliated

with chrysochromulinaceae and novel clades consisting

of environmental sequences only the only cultured

species found exclusively in the pico size fraction was

chrysochromulina rotalis size fractionation by in line filtra 

tion obviously does not separate the pico and nanoplank 

tonic populations perfectly but the size fraction in which

an otu is predominantly found can give an indication of

its cell size range 

observations by electron microscopy

all samples analysed by pyrosequencing were also

examined qualitatively by either tem or sem or both the

haptophyte species observed by electron microscopy in

this study are listed in table and described more in

detail under each taxonomic group below 

support for novel classes of haptophytes

hap fig 
several of the otus matched environmental sequences

that form novel clades we detected four otus which

with good support grouped together with an environmen 

tal sequence isolated from surface waters of the marmara

sea turkey previously suggested to represent a putative

new class level clade of haptophytes hap simon et al 

 in our phylogenetic analysis this clade also

included the environmental clone shax isolated from

 m depth in the saanich inlet british colombia canada

 orsi et al this clade has only ca sequence

similarity to representatives from either of the two for 

mally described classes of haptophytes and its position in

the haptophyte phylogeny is unstable in our analysis this

clade was placed sister to pavlovophycae but the place 

ment was not supported simon et al found

it to either branch as a sister group of pavlovophyceae or

at the base of both pavlovophyceae and prymnesiophy 

ceae but neither of the placements were supported nev 

ertheless our results confirm the existence of this clade 

and indicate that it consists of several species 

hap and hap fig 
the phylogenetic analyses suggest the existence of two

additional new classes here termed “hap ” and “hap 

 ” six of otus were affiliated with hap which con 

sists of four environmental sequences previously isolated

from the caribbean sea edgcomb et al at

 m depth in the sargasso sea countway et al 

 m depth in the saanich inlet canada orsi

et al and the north pacific frias lopez et al 

 while the support for this clade was good 

its placement in the haptophyte tree was uncertain fur 

thermore there was considerable divergence also within

the clade the environmental sequences in this clade were

only – similar over the part of s rdna they over 
lapped 

the two environmental clones shac isolated from

 m in the saanich inlet orsi et al and

fs aa aug m from the florida strait cuvelier

et al formed a clade with weak support in the tree

without of otus fig s a here termed hap the

 th most abundant otu otu in the dataset was

 similar to shac which in turn was – 
similar to members of prymnesiophyceae and ca 

similar to members of pavlovophyceae as determined by

a manual blast search against ncbi nr otus 

and were also placed in this clade but with no sup 

port fig over the entire s rdna the divergence

between the established classes pavlovophyceae and

prymnesiophyceae is ca edvardsen et al 

although the divergence between sequences will depend

on the region of the s rdna under consideration it

seems these environmental lineages are divergent enough

to warrant the erection of new classes once the morpho 

logies of these species are known 

evidence for novel deep branching lineages has also

been found from cultured strains the marine strain cg 

isolated from south africa was here placed among the

hap clades but with no certain position in the haptophyte

phylogeny a description of this new species possibly rep 

resenting a new haptophyte class is underway sym et al 

unpubl data 

diversity within established clades

class pavlovophyceae fig 
only four otus were placed within the pavlovophyceae

 otu and this class is much less

diverse than prymnesiophyceae with only formally

described species of which all are genetically character 

ised in the s rdna e g bendif et al however 

as for the prymnesiophyceae the species richness of

pavlovophyceae is probably higher than what is currently

described all four otus were placed as sister groups to

rak or kattegat but a strain of diacronema ennorea uio

 was isolated by jahn throndsen from the oslofjor 

den and the s rdna has been sequenced egge et al 

 

clade d fig 
clade d has been shown to be a well supported clade

consisting only of environmental sequences but with an

uncertain position in prymnesiophyceae in s rdna trees

 edvardsen et al moon van der staay et al 

we detected one member of this clade otu which

was identical to an environmental sequence from the mar 

mara sea turkey jx previously shown to nest

within this clade simon et al members of clade d

were here placed basally within class prymnesiophyceae

and are expected to represent a novel order within this

class edvardsen et al 

order phaeocystales fig 
altogether otus nested within order phaeocystales of

which four matched cultured species table interest 

ingly the overall second most abundant otu otu was

identical to p cordata which has not previously been

recorded in the skagerrak eikrem edvardsen pers com 

mun kuylenstierna and karlson over the course of

this study otu was proportionally abundant in april and

may egge et al unpubl data phaeocystis like cells have

previously been observed to reach maximum abundance

in spring in skagerrak april kuylenstierna and

karlson phaeocystis cordata does not form colonies

 zingone et al therefore it is easily overlooked and

difficult to distinguish from swarmers of p globosa and p 

pouchetii the colony forming p pouchetii and p globosa

are both previously reported from skagerrak table s 

and known to constitute large components of the phyto 

plankton community during spring in north eastern atlan 

tic waters e g christaki et al paasche 

these two species were also detected in our study by

 pyrosequencing otu and otu respectively as

p globosa and p pouchetii are both similar to p 
cordata in the v region we are confident that p cordata

was not confounded with these species in the taxonomic

assignation members of phaeocystis were detected by

electron microscopy in this study but they could not be

identified to species fig a–c 
otu matched a newly genetically characterised free 

living strain isolated from the north east atlantic strain

pcc decelle et al placed within the phaeocys 

tis jahnii clade 

our analyses indicate the existence of novel clades or

species complexes within phaeocystales together with

environmental sequences isolated from the pacific north

and south otu otu otu otu and

otu formed a well supported clade further 

otu and formed a clade with environmental

sequences from the florida strait and northern pacific 

otu and together with an uncultured clone isolated

from the south atlantic were placed as a sister clade to

the p pouchetii antarctica globosa clade this group was

not supported and the otus may therefore belong

to either p globosa or to the p pouchetii p antarctica

clade according to medlin and zingone several

phaeocystis species have been recognised that are not

yet formally described 

order prymnesiales
in total otus were placed within the order

prymnesiales of which matched cultured species

 table within this order we detected members of sev 

eral well supported groups consisting of only environmen 

tal sequences but the phylogenetic placement of these

clades relative to described genera in prymnesiales was

uncertain for instance nine environmental sequences

including one isolated from freshwater lake finsevatn 

norway shalchian tabrizi et al formed a well 

supported group fig s c which was named clade b in

an earlier study simon et al seven of otus were

affiliated with this group but the group itself was no

longer supported once the of otus were included in the

tree fig interestingly two of the otus detected in

clade b otu and were only found in the

pico size fraction and the environmental sequences

hm and ef were obtained from a flow

cytometry sorted picoplanktonic sample cuvelier et al 

 and a sample prefiltered through lm filter not
et al respectively this could indicate that this

clade is predominantly picoplanktonic which might explain

why it so far has no cultured and described species thir 

teen of otus were placed in another novel clade within

prymnesiales here termed clade b which had good sup 

port in the reference tree fig s c however the place 

ments of these otus were for the most part not

supported fig and the placement of the clade itself

was uncertain 

order prymnesiales – family chrysochromulinaceae
 fig 
several otus matched environmental sequences placed

in or near the clade containing chrysochromulina leadbea 

teri and c simplex this clade has previously been shown

to contain undescribed diversity edvardsen et al

ence tree it was therefore not possible to give otu a

certain phylogenetic placement and it may thus represent

one or more of these three species nevertheless the

total diversity in this particular clade of chrysochromulina

may be higher than what can be resolved in this study 

the species in this clade are covered by cup formed body

scales as is chrysochromulina camella a species not yet

genetically characterised in the s rdna chrysochromu 

lina scales resembling most those of c camella were

observed in the electron microscope fig k we might

thus speculate that otu could represent c camella 

the clade containing c rotalis chrysochromulina

throndsenii chrysochromulina acantha and c parva also

contained several environmental sequences and species

with identical sequence in the v region for instance

otu which had mismatch with c acantha and

sequences of two endosymbionts of the foraminifera

globigerinella siphonifera af and af could

not be reliably placed and it might indeed represent more

than one species further c acantha and c throndsenii

are only bp different in the v region and might not be

possible to separate chrysochromulina throndsenii was

observed with electron microscopy in this study fig l 

members of the chrysochromulina genus can be recogni 

sed by their saddle shaped cells edvardsen et al 

morphologically described saddle shaped species that

have been observed in skagerrak but are not yet

sequenced include chrysochromulina alifera and chrys 

ochromulina ephippium eikrem and moestrup 

jensen a chrysochromulina ephippium was also

observed in this study fig g h thus these are possi 

ble candidates for of otus placed within chrysochromuli 

na but without match to a cultured species 

order prymnesiales – family prymnesiaceae fig 
five otus were affiliated with the genus haptolina otu

 had one mismatch with haptolina fragaria h ericina h 

cf herdlensis h hirta and two environmental sequences 

and may thus represent one or several of these species 

seventeen otus were affiliated with prymnesium of

which p polylepis and p kappa were the only cultured

and sequenced species detected otu matched a strain

of imantonia isolated from the bering strait otu had

four mismatches with pseudohaptolina arctica which sug 

gests that it could represent a new species in the genus

pseudohaptolina otu matched chrysocampanula

spinifera chrysocampanula spinifera haptolina ericina h 

fragaria h hirta and p polylepis were also detected in

em table fig d–f 
the high number of novel sequences within prymnesi 

ales is consistent with the diversity of chrysochromulina

 sensu lato observed in previous surveys of the skagerrak

and kattegat both formally described and nondescribed

forms backe hansen and throndsen eikrem 

jensen a jensen a recorded morphological

species of chrysochromulina sensu lato and in addition

scales of nondescribed forms with morphologies

resembling this group many of these undescribed forms

were quantitatively important contributors to the chrys 

ochromulina population jensen a of the morpholog 

ical forms reported by jensen have until now been

genetically characterised table s four of these were

not detected by pyrosequencing in this survey 

prymnesium minus p chiton haptolina brevifila and c 

throndsenii although we detected otus closely matching

sequences of h brevifila and c throndsenii table s 

unreported and undescribed prymnesiales like cells were

detected in sem such as the chrysochromulina like cell

in fig i j and the scale covering in fig b further we

detected chrysochromulina mactra in tem fig a this

seems to be a common species in skagerrak but it has

not yet been genetically characterised the morphology of

this species rounded cell shape and similar length of fla 

gella and haptonema indicates that it belongs in prymne 

siaceae edvardsen et al 

a high novel diversity within prymnesiales has similarly

been revealed by recent studies targeting the s rdna

gene by pyrosequencing of samples from the medi 

terranean bittner et al and by cloning and sanger

sequencing of oceanic picohaptophytes liu et al 

subclass calcihaptophycidae fig 
‘calcihaptophycidae’ has been introduced as a subclass

comprising the monophyletic entity of potentially calcifying

haptophytes de vargas et al i e including noncalci 

fying species phylogenetically affiliated with coccolitho 

phores such as isochrysis this category is convenient for

novel environmental sequences affiliated with the cocco 

lithophores as it is not known whether they represent

actually calcifying species however in our analysis the

calcihaptophycidae was not supported either with or with 

out of otus included in the trees fig s d a clade

consisting entirely of environmental sequences which is

here termed clade f branched off before the clade of

described orders of coccolithophores except braarudosph 

aeraceae although this placement was not supported 

clade f was distinct from the previously inferred clade e

 moon van der staay et al which also so far only

consists of environmental sequences interestingly otu

 which matched environmental sequence b h in clade

f isolated from sea ice in the baltic majaneva et al 

 was proportionally dominating in the reads from

samples taken april and march and detected in

both the pico and nano size fractions egge et al unpubl 

data although not much is known about the cell size of

this putative novel species assuming that the high propor 

tion of reads corresponds to high proportion of biomass 

this indicates that it constitutes an important part of the

haptophyte spring community further this shows that

even seemingly abundant species in the environment

remain to be cultured and genetically characterised in

total six of otus were affiliated with clade f we

detected one member of clade e otu which was

only found in the pico size fraction further otu fell in

a clade with the cultured species chrysoculter rhomboi 

deus a sister taxa to members of clade e and may repre 

sent a novel species of chrysoculter two otus were

placed in the braarudosphaera bigelowii chrysochromulina

sequence was isolated from a freshwater lake in france

 simon et al the most abundant otu otu in

detected both with sem fig a and pyrosequenc 

ing otus identical to sequences of calyptrosphaera

sphaeroidea calcidiscus leptoporus and coccolithus

pelagicus were recovered all of which have previously

been reported from microscopy surveys table s in this

study also corrisphaera sp fig d was recorded in

sem the total number of coccolithophore species previ 

ously observed in skagerrak by microscopy methods was

higher spp than what we recovered here by 

otus table some species may have identical s

rdna v region such as e huxleyi and g oceanica or be

joined in a common haplo diploid life cycle with distinct

morphologies which shows the need for combining

molecular and microscopical methods

diversity of haptophytes revealed by pyrosequencing egge et al 



methodological considerations

diversity lost in the sampling process 
by prefiltering through a lm mesh we could miss out
on haptophytes attached to particles or marine snow in

symbiosis with organisms lm or species forming
colonies such as phaeocystis spp however prefiltration

was performed to prevent metazoan ciliate or dinoflagel 

late sequences from dominating the pyrosequencing

results due to their large cell size and putatively high rrna

content further haptophyte community composition may

vary by depth e g bittner et al for instance some

coccolithophores may dwell deeper in the water column

 malinverno et al thus the samples included in

this study obtained from m depth may under represent

the full haptophyte diversity in the water column the

diversity of all protist groups in samples taken at the deep

chlorophyll maximum from the same sampling cruises will

be presented in a following study gran stadnicze nko
et al unpubl data 

chimeras
the proportion of unique otus flagged as chimeras was

here very high of unique otus however most
of these were represented as reads each and thus
did not constitute a large proportion of the total number of

reads a mechanism for chimera formation with a cdna

protocol with random primers was suggested in egge

et al under cdna synthesis random primers may

anneal within the target region and cdna strands that

only cover a part of the target region may be created if

this part is copied in the first round of the pcr it might

act as a long nonspecifically binding primer in subsequent

rounds of the pcr and thus create chimeras chimeras

between closely related taxa may not be detected by chi 

mera check programmes e g perseus and in this case

an additional thorough manual check by blast and visual

inspection of alignments were needed 

concluding remarks
pyrosequencing revealed higher species richness of hapto 

phytes than previously observed with electron and light

microscopy in the skagerrak novel lineages were detected 

ranging from species to class level in particular we

observed high uncultured diversity within the order prym 

nesiales considering that some closely related species

have identical s v rdna regions the true richness may

be even higher at this point we can only speculate about

the possible ecological functions of these environmental

clades this study in particular highlights the lack of overlap

between morphological descriptions and genetic characteri 

sation of haptophytes our work contributes to linking geno 

type to phenotype within this ecologically important protist

group and reveals great unknown diversity
