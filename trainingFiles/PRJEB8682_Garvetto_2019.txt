chytrids have long been recognised as important parasites of microalgae in freshwater systems able to
shape the dynamics of blooms the gene pool of their host and phytoplankton succession in the sea
however where the presence of these organisms is erratic and ephemeral studies concerning chytrids
are sparse and confined to metabarcoding surveys or microscopy observations despite the scarcity of
data chytrid epidemics are supposed to play an important role in marine biogeochemical cycles being
one of the drivers of phytoplankton dynamics here we combine microscopy observations and in silico
mining of a single cell whole genome to molecularly and morphologically characterise a novel chytrid
parasite of the dominant diatom genus skeletonema morphological observations highlight features of the
thallus and ascertain the parasitic nature of the interaction whilst the genetic markers obtained allows
for a phylogenetic reconstruction placing the new species in the order rhizophydiales thanks to the
molecular data obtained we are also able to provide a first investigation of the global distribution of this
organism by screening the ocean sampling day osd dataset highlighting a northern transatlantic
dissemination

 introduction

zoosporic true fungi belonging to the early diverged phylum
chytridiomycota hibbett et al are widespread microor 
ganisms known to dominate the fungal community in freshwater
ecosystems monchy et al jobard et al where they
play an important role as parasites and saprobes gleason et al 
 frenken et al parasitic associations of chytrids with
microalgae have long been known in lentic systems canter and
lund sparrow where chytrid propagules act as an
important carrier of fixed carbon from inedible algae to grazing
zooplankters by means of the mycoloop kagami et al and
are suspected to be one of the main drivers maintaining the genetic
diversity of their algal hosts through highly host specific associa 
tions ibelings et al de bruin et al gsell et al

despite the prevalence of studies targeting lakes chytrids have
been recorded as a major component of t he microbial community
in various ecosystems by means of molecular surveys especially in
extreme habitats such as alpine snow naff et al sea ice
 hassett et al high elevation soils freeman et al 
and marine hydrothermal vents le calvez et al whenever
these habitats allow for the survival of photosynthetic organisms 
the co occurrence freeman et al naff et al brown
et al or parasitic association hassett and gradinger 
hassett et al between phototrophs and chytrids has been
reported in the sea recent metabarcoding surveys unveiled an
unexpectedly large and undescribed biodiversity within the chy 
tridiomycota comeau et al hassett and gradinger 
hassett et al despite not being the yearlong dominant
fungal taxon picard a high abundance of chytrids in the
plankton was often recorded in short time windows matching
coastal blooms of phytoplankters such as diatoms taylor and
cunliffe in less productive marine ecosystems such as
open ocean oligotrophic gyres chytrids have been found

parasitising dominant photosynthetic picoeukaryotes within the
families chrysophyceae and prymnesiophyceae lep�ere et al 
 even if culturing remains a paramount step to fully appre 
ciate and understand the biology of these organisms establishing
and maintaining a dual culture of the parasite and its host i e 
pathosystem in the laboratory is challenging rad men�endez et al 
 the isolation of chytrids is further complicated by the erratic
and ephemeral presence of these “dazzling and elusive creatures”
in the field sparrow therefore most of the information on
chytrid ecological role and diversity is underpinned by either
sparse microscopic observations that are informative regarding the
parasitic interaction but often lack taxonomic resolution or by
broad molecular surveys which provide sequencing data and an
overview of chytrid phylogenetic diversity but can only be sug 
gestive in terms of ecological function for these reasons a big part
of chytrid diversity is assigned to the undescribed uncultivated and
functionally uncharacterised dark matter fungi grossart et al 
 hindering the appreciation of their role in ecosystem dy 
namics and global biogeochemical cycles 

diatoms within the genus skeletonema are among the main
contributors to planktonic primary productivity in coastal
temperate areas worldwide often representing the dominant
diatom during the spring bloom borkman and smayda 
canesi and rynearson this diatom genus often constitutes
the basis of foodwebs bergkvist et al and can account for up
to of the microphytoplankton community during seasonal
blooms canesi and rynearson whilst the contribution and
effects of zooplankton grazing has been extensively studied
 bergkvist et al amato et al only one study reports
chytrids infecting skeletonema addressing their role in bloom dy 
namics and phytoplankton species succession off the chilean coast
 guti�errez et al here using a method that combines mi 
croscopy and single cell whole genome amplification we identify a
novel chytrid species infecting skeletonema sp from the west coast
of scotland we provide a morphological description molecular
identification and a phylogenetic placement for this chytrid within
the rhizophydiales finally thanks to the obtained molecular data 
we use the osd worldwide metabarcoding database kopf et al 
 to investigate the global distribution of this new species 

 methods

 isolation of the biological material

plankton samples were collected on the th of april off
the pontoon of the scottish association for marine science

 reads the selected contigs were further merged to the
sanger sequences into two supercontigs spanning the nearly

in a complementary attempt to retrieve the complete rdna
operon we generated a de novo assembly of skchyt in clc ge 
nomics work bench https www qiagenbioinformatics com 
 and queried the resulting contigs using the s sequence
obtained by pcr on skchyt this approach resulted in the selection

lapping identical to all the sequences previously obtained by
pcr and in silico the s sequence obtained by pcr filled the gap
between the two contigs allowing for the assembly of the complete
rdna operon which was retained for following phylogenetic
analysis the different methods used to reconstruct the full rdna
operon are summarized in supplementary fig the rdna operon
was manually annotated in geneious by blast against gen 
ebank introns were analysed with the same software in order to
test whether they contained coding dna sequences cds and
further annotated via uniprot the entirety of the rdna operon for
the isolate skchyt was deposited in genbank under the accession

 phylogenetic reconstructions

a custom dataset of the s s and s rdna sequences of
chytrids was built paying particular attention to sample diversity
within the rhizophydiales letcher et al since preliminary
analysis pointed towards an inclusion of isolate skchyt into this
order sequences for each gene were aligned separately using the
mafft katoh et al algorithm implemented in geneious
 and manually curated to remove the non informative introns
its and its substitution models were assessed for each gene
separately in iq tree nguyen et al through model 
finder kalyaanamoorthy et al resulting in tim þr s
and s and tpm u þ r s a manual concatenation of the
three alignments was then analysed in iq tree with a parti 
tioned model chernomor et al allowing each gene to
evolve at its own pace espp option phylogenetic reconstructions
were computed with a maximum likelihood method using a 
replicates ultrafast bootstrap approximation ufboot test of phy 
logeny minh et al aiming at including a better represen 
tation of uncultured environmental diversity a phylogenetic
reconstruction based on rhizophydiales s was computed with
the same above described procedure under the gtr þ r model of
molecular evolution finally for consistency with previous work on
alphamycetaceae and rhizophydiales phylogeny reconstructions
 letcher et al seto and degawa we used a concate 
nation of s substitution model sym þ i þ g and s sub 
stitution model tim þg to further confirm the phylogenetic
position of our isolate 

 assessment of global distribution

the v hypervariable region of the s rdna of isolate skchy 
was used to query the raw metabarcode datasets of the ocean
sampling day through the sequence read archive sra 
 prjeb kopf et al using an in house script referred to as
moulinette which implements edirect and sra toolkit utilities
 badis et al subm briefly moulinette extracts from sra
deposited metabarcoding datasets all reads matching a given query
sequence above given identity coverage and e value thresholds 
here a rather stringent approach was used i e reads were only
retained when at least identical over of their length to the
query sequence refer to suppl material for details on the pa 
rameters used paired reads were filtered expected error over 
and aligned to the v hypervariable region of the s of isolate
skchyt in geneious resulting in two clusters divided by a
shared synapomorphy otu and otu identity matrices were
generated to investigate the percentage of identity between the
reads and skchyt v s rdnawith the same software sampling
stations were deemed positive for the presence of the investigated
organism and therefore retained when merged paired reads
were detected for these stations gps coordinates were extracted

structures consistent with one of the modality of sexual repro 
duction in the order rhizophydiales where a contributing spore
 male gamete encysts on a receptive thallus female gamete to
which it transfers its cytoplasmic contents resulting in the forma 
tion of the thick walled resting spore sparrow van den
wyngaert et al in line with morphological evidence the
nearly complete rdna operon obtained in silico for isolate skchyt 
confirmed that this epibiotic parasite of skeletonema belongs to the
order rhizophydiales in the phylum chytridiomycota within this
order our isolate is firmly placed within a well supported group
composed of the families alphamycetaceae and kappamycetaceae
 letcher and powell letcher et al however the
skeletonema infecting chytrid does not clearly belong to any of
these two families in our concatenated phylogenetic reconstruction
 fig instead isolate skchyt clusters sister to the alphamyce 
taceae with a very weak ultrafast bootstrap support the
family alphamycetaceae is divided in two main groups the first
composed of the genus betamyces alone and the second composed
of the genera alphamyces and gammamyces those two main sub 
clades have previously been found not to be supported by strong
bootstraps letcher et al seto and degawa a feature
consistent with our se s phylogenetic reconstruction where
the alphamycetaceae appear paraphyletic fig even if in this
latter phylogenetic reconstruction the parasitoid of skeletonema
clusters closer to the genera alphamyces and gammamyces any
conclusion on the affinity of skchyt to extant taxa would be
assumptive in the absence of taxonomically informative data on
zoospore ultrastructure james et al and of a broader
sequenced diversity within the rhizophydiales as comparison we
refrain from any taxonomic treatment of the investigated skel 
etonema parasitoid and we adopt the provisional name skchyt 
following published guidelines for temporary nomenclature for
protists berney et al 

we used phylogenetic analyses of molecular data from s 
based metabarcoding surveys to assess whether chytrids related to
skchyt shared similar habitats or ecological strategies high boot 
strap support fig places skchyt sister to the saprobe
betamyces sp barr smith et al and to a well supported
clade of isolates from freshwater antarctic cyanobacterial mats
 jungblut et al a glacier forefield in tibet khan and kong 
unpublished and japanese lakes ishida et al no marine
isolate clusters close to skchyt and only three isolates come from
marine brackish water in our phylogenetic reconstruction this
result is likely an artefact due to the undersampling of the marine
environment potentially coupled with the marked seasonality
shown by chytrids in the plankton picard the latter can be
exacerbated in the case of parasites whose ephemeral presence
and short lasting dynamics remain often undetected by molecular
surveys garvetto et al the global distribution of the skchyt
highlighted its presence in coastal areas around the north atlantic
 fig since the ocean sampling day campaign is limited to
coastal areas sampled at one time point st of june kopf et al 
 we cannot exclude that skchyt may also occur in the open
sea likewise we cannot rule out the hypothesis that a strong
seasonality for the studied chytrid possibly driven by its diatom
host might have prevented its detection in the southern hemi 
sphere where skeletonema is virtually absent during the austral
winter indeed microscopic evidence of a chytrid parasite infecting
skeletonema sp in the humboldt current system off central chile
was recently reported but unfortunately no matching molecular
data were available guti�errez et al this chytrid was
hypothesised to infect both skeletonema sp and thalassiosira sp 
during the austral spring and late summer therefore driving the
phytoplankton succession by allowing for the development of
blooms of the immune diatom chaetoceros sp on the other hand 
one operational taxonomic unit otu closely related to beta 
myces americaemeridionalis arg and therefore to skchyt was
detected for three years and in co occurrence
with chaetoceros sp dominated blooms in the english channel
 taylor and cunliffe although no direct observation of
parasitism exists these results strongly suggest that chaetoceros
might be a host of otu our observations do not allow specula 
tions on the infection of hosts other than skeletonema since both
thalassiosira and chaetoceros were present only in very low

abundances in our samples and none was found to bear sporangia 
the peculiar detached sporangia described in guti�errez et al 
were not observed in the samples investigated here where all
chytrid thalli grew epiphytically on skeletonema colonies 

our screening of metabarcoding datasets highlighted the pres 
ence of two otus clustering around skchyt with an identity
varying from to otu and from to otu 
each of them shared synapomorphies on the v hypervariable re 
gion of the s rdna gene detailed in supplementary fig 
suggesting that these two otus correspond to genuine distinct
taxa whether or not the two otus retrieved in this study belong to
different yet closely related species the possibility that other chy 
trid parasites infecting marine diatoms fall within the clade
alphamycetaceae kappamycetaceae should also be considered 

thanks to the combination of pcr and hiseq sequencing we
identified an intronic sequence one base pair upstream the primer
binding site used for the amplification of the v hypervariable re 
gion a second intron contains a coding sequence for a homing
endonuclease enzyme indicating that it is active and spreading
within skchyt population chevalier and stoddard the
presence of intronic sequences a well known feature for the s
ribosomal rna of chytrids and other fungi karpov et al may
therefore interfere with the amplification of metabarcodes it
should be envisaged that metabarcoding studies despite their
proven power in unveiling hidden planktonic microbial diversity
 de vargas et al may suffer from such biases especially
towards certain taxa we argue that the caveats described here
might have been causing a strong underappreciation of the influ 
ence of fungal parasites on skeletonema and other marine diatom
blooms possibly causing biases in modelling food webs and
biogeochemical cycles to date predation is believed to be the
largest source of mortality of phytoplankton calbet and landry 
 causing changes in prey physiology and behaviour amato
et al with effects potentially cascading throughout the
food web but little if any information on parasitism is included in
marine food web models in the diatom dominated silica cycle 
fungal epidemics might influence the temporal scale of transport to
the benthos where the majority of silica recycling occurs serpetti
et al furthermore examples from freshwater systems have
been pointing towards the involvement of chytrids in driving the
succession of dominant phytoplankters van donk and ringelberg 
 and results fromguti�errez et al seem to confirm these
observations in the marine habitat molecular markers obtained by
sc analyses may constitute a useful tool to target taxa that remain
undetected in metabarcoding surveys with the added benefit of
potentially linking barcodes to ecological functions thus empow 
ering the ecological interpretation of long term plankton time se 
ries we hope that the molecular data provided here will help
triggering further investigation on the presence and function of
marine chytrids which have the potential to be important drivers
