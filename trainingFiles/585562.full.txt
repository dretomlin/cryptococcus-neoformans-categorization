abstract 

 

the amazon river receives from the surrounding rainforest huge amounts of 

terrestrial organic matter teom which is typically resistant to microbial degradation 

however only a small fraction of the teom ends up in the ocean indicating that most of it is 

degraded in the river so far the nature of the genes involved in teom degradation and their 

spatial distributions are barely known here we examined the amazon river microbiome 

gene repertoire and found that it contains a substantial gene novelty compared to other 

environments rivers and rainforest soil we predicted million non redundant genes 

affiliating mostly to bacteria the gene functions involved in teom degradation revealed 

that lignin degradation correlated to tricarboxylates and hemicellulose processing pointing to 

higher lignin degradation rates under consumption of labile compounds we describe the 

biochemical machinery that could be speeding up the decomposition of recalcitrant 

compounds in amazonian waters previously reported only in incubation experiments

introduction 

 

continental waters play a major biogeochemical role by linking terrestrial and 

marine ecosystems riverine ecosystems receive terrestrial organic carbon which is mostly 

processed by microorganisms stimulating the conversion of terrestrially derived organic 

matter teom which can be recalcitrant to carbon dioxide – therefore riverine 

microbiomes should have evolved metabolisms capable of degrading teom even though the 

gene repertoire of river microbiomes can provide crucial insights to understand the links 

between terrestrial and marine ecosystems as well as the fate of organic matter synthesized 

on land very little is known about the genomic machinery of riverine microbes that degrade 

teom 

microbiome gene catalogues allow the characterization of the functional repertoire 

linking genes with ecological function and ecosystem services recently large gene 

catalogues have been produced for the global ocean – soils and animal guts in 

particular million genes have been reported for the global ocean microbiome and 

million genes for the global topsoil microbiome 

so far there is no comprehensive gene catalogue for rivers which hinders our 

comprehension of the genomic machinery that degrade almost half of the pg c of 

recalcitrant teom that are discharged into rivers every year this is particularly relevant in 

tropical rainforests like the amazon forest which accounts for of the global primary 

production fixating pg c per year the amazon river basin comprises almost 

of continental south america and its discharge accounts for of the world’s inland 

water inputs to the oceans despite its relevance for global scale processes there is a limited 

understanding of the amazon river microbiome as well as microbiomes from other large 

tropical rivers

the large amounts of organic and inorganic particulate material turns the amazon 

river into a turbid system high turbidity reduces light penetration and consequently the 

amazon river has very low rates of algal production meaning that the dissolved organic 

carbon cycling at the terrestrial–aquatic interface is the major carbon source for microbial 

growth high respiration rates in amazon river waters generate a super saturation that 

leads to co outgassing to the atmosphere overall amazon river outgassing accounts for 

 pg c per year to the atmosphere almost equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered 

by the forest despite the predominantly recalcitrant nature of the teom that is 

discharged into the amazon river heterotrophic microbes are able to degrade up to of 

the lignin produced by the rainforest the unexpectedly high degradation rates of some 

teom compounds in the river was recently explained by the availability of labile compounds 

that promote the degradation of recalcitrant ones a mechanism known as priming effect 

which has been observed in incubation experiments 

determining the repertoire of gene functions in the amazon river microbiome is one 

of the key steps to understand the mechanisms involved in the degradation of complex teom 

produced by the rainforest given that most teom present in the amazon river is lignin and 

cellulose – the functions associated to their degradation were expected to be widespread in 

the amazon microbiome instead these functions exhibited very low abundances – 

highlighting our limited understanding of the enzymes involved in the degradation of lignin 

and cellulose in aquatic systems 

cellulolytic bacteria use an arsenal of enzymes with synergistic and complementary 

activities to degrade cellulose for example glycosyl hydrolases ghs catalyze the 

hydrolysis of glycoside linkages polysaccharide esterases support the action of ghs over 

hemicelluloses and polysaccharide lyases promote depolymerisation in contrast lignin is 

more resistant to degradation since its role is preventing microbial enzymes from degrading

labile cell wall polysaccharides the microbial production of extracellular hydrogen 

peroxide a highly reactive compound is the first step of lignin oxidation mediated by 

enzymes like lignin peroxidase manganese dependent peroxidase and copper dependent 

laccases lignin oxidation also produces a complex mixture of aromatic compounds which 

compose the humic fraction of dissolved carbon detected in previous studies in the amazon 

river mainstream lignin degradation tends to occur in oxic waters of the amazon river 

using the hydrogen peroxide produced by the metabolism of cellulose and hemicellulose 

therefore a higher amount of lignin degradation genes is expected in oxic waters 

here we produced the first gene catalogue of the world’s largest rainforest river by 

analyzing metagenomes x base pairs originating from stations covering a 

total of km from the upper solimões river to the amazon river plume in the 

atlantic ocean this gene catalogue was used to uncover and examine the genomic 

machinery of the amazon river microbiome to metabolize large amounts of carbon 

originating from the surrounding rainforest specifically we ask how novel is the gene 

repertoire of the amazon river microbiome which are the main functions associated to 

teom degradation do teom degradation genes and functions have a spatial distribution 

pattern is there any evidence of priming effect in teom degradation

longer than bp allowing also for alternative initiation codons after redundancy 

elimination through clustering genes with an identity and an overlap of the 

shorter gene the amazon river basin microbial non redundant gene catalogue amnrgc 

included non redundant genes with half of the genes with a length ≥ bp about 

 of the amnrgc genes were annotated with at least one database fig b while 

of the annotated genes were simultaneously annotated using two or more different databases 

the gene and functional diversity recovered seemed to be representative of the total diversity 

present in the sampling sites as indicated by the accumulation curves which tended towards 

saturation fig c 

 

patterns in the metagenomic composition of microbiomes 

we compared the metagenomic information contained in the amazon river 

microbiome with that of amazon rainforest soil and other rivers canada watersheds and 

mississippi river the k mer comparison of microbiomes indicated they are different 

 fig d forming groups of heterogenous composition significant β dispersion that is 

average distance of samples to the group centroid permutest f p the 

metagenomic content of amazon basin samples was different to the other compared 

microbiomes permanova r p x anosim r p 

which suggests that this basin or tropical rivers in general contain specific gene repertoires 

the metagenomic composition of the five sampled sections of the amazon river upstream 

downstream estuary plume and ocean were significantly different permanova test f 

 p e indicating that they do represent different assemblages from a genetic 

perspective each of these groups was considered homogenous since there was a non 

significant β dispersion f p among metagenomic samples in each group

gene identification 

about of the amnrgc genes could not be annotated due to lack of orthologs 

besides even though of the genes in the amnrgc were previously found in 

metagenomic studies they were poorly characterized without being assigned to a particular 

taxon here referred to as “metagenomic” genes fig b genes annotated exclusively 

through hidden markov models hmm represented of amnrgc fig b as the 

annotation using hmm profiles does not rely on direct orthology to specific sequences but 

on orthology to a protein family which may include mixed taxonomic signal we could not 

assign taxonomy to those genes and they are referred as “unassigned genes” fig b 

the previous highlights our limited understanding about the gene composition of the 

amazon river microbiome where most proteins do not have orthologs in main 

reference databases taxonomically assigned prokaryotic genes bacterial and 

archaeal constituted the majority in the amnrgc with only and of the genes 

having eukaryotic or viral origin respectively fig b 

 

general or core metabolisms 

the superclass “metabolic processes” from the clusters of orthologous genes 

 cog database comprises those gene functions belonging either to energy production and 

conversion amino acids nucleotides carbohydrates coenzymes lipids and inorganic ions 

transport and metabolism and secondary metabolites biosynthesis transport and catabolism 

this superclass was the most abundant in the amnrgc of the genes annotated with 

cog classes fig genes with unknown function represented of the cog class 

annotated proteins 

metabolism core functions were defined as those involved in cell or ecosystem 

homeostasis normally representing the minimal metabolic machinery needed to survive in a

given environment kegg and pfam databases were used to determine the bacterial 

functional core also allowing the identification of metabolic pathways core functions 

represented of kegg and pfam functions and were mostly related to a general carbon 

metabolism mostly associated to general organic matter oxidation until co and the 

microbial respiration byproducts heading to acetogenic pathways besides the core the most 

abundant proteins can reveal essential biochemical pathways in microbiomes the top 

most abundant functions in the bacterial core were “house keeping” functions involved in 

main metabolic pathways e g carbohydrate metabolism quorum sensing transporters and 

amino acid metabolism as well as important protein complexes e g rna and dna 

polymerases and atp synthase 

 

teom degradation machinery 

a total of genes from the amnrgc were identified as taking part in the teom 

degradation machinery of the amazon river microbiome being divided into cellulose 

degradation genes hemicellulose degradation genes lignin oxidation genes 

lignin derived aromatic compounds transport and metabolism genes and 

tricarboxylate transport genes supplementary fig the huge gene diversity 

associated to metabolism of lignin derived compounds and the transport of tricarboxylates 

reflects the molecular diversity of the compounds generated respectively in the lignin 

oxidation process and present in amazon freshwaters as humic and fulvic acids 

 

initial steps of teom degradation lignin oxidation and deconstruction of cellulose and 

hemicellulose 

teom consists of biopolymers so the first step of its microbial degradation consists 

in converting polymers into monomers thus the identified genes involved in the oxidation

of lignin and degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose were investigated supplementary 

fig we found that the lignin oxidation in the amazon river is mainly mediated by dye 

decolorizing peroxidases dyps and predominantly associated to freshwaters only laccases 

and peroxidases were found in the amazon river microbiome no other families involved in 

lignin oxidation like phenolic acid decarboxylase or glyoxal oxidase were found in turn 

hemicellulose degradation seems to be performed mainly by glycosyl hydrolase gh in all 

river sections we observed a similar ubiquitous dominance of glycosyl hydrolase gh in 

cellulose degradation across river sections interestingly according to the gene content 

cellulose and hemicellulose degradation seemed to replace lignin oxidation in brackish 

waters suggesting the aging of teom during its flow through the river 

 

lignin derived aromatic compounds degradation 

following the initial degradation of lignin plenty of aromatic compounds are 

released these can be divided into aromatic monomers monoaryls or dimers diaryls 

which can be processed through several biochemical steps also called funneling pathways 

until being converted into vanilate or syringate these compounds can be processed through 

the o demethylation c metabolism and ring cleavage pathways to form pyruvate or 

oxaloacetate which can be incorporated to the tca cycle of the cells generating energy the 

genes identified in the amnrgc belonging to these pathways were examined 

all known functions taking place in the metabolism of lignin derived aromatic 

compounds were found in the amnrgc except the gene ligd a cα dehydrogenase for αr 

isomers of β aryl ethers the complete degradation pathway of lignin derived compounds 

 supplementary fig d included and genes belonging to funneling pathways of 

diaryls and monoaryls respectively examination of the pathways starting with vanilate and 

syringate revealed genes responsible for the o demethylation and c metabolism steps

while genes seemed responsible for the ring cleavage pathway almost of all genes 

related to the degradation of lignin derived compounds in the amnrgc belonged to gene 

families ligh desv phcd or phcc these genes represent the main steps of intracellular 

lignin metabolism which are funneling pathways leading to vanilate syringate o 

demethylation c metabolism and ring cleavage 

we evaluated whether genes associated to teom degradation had a spatial 

distribution pattern along the river course for this we used the linear geographic distance of 

samples from the amazon river source in peru as a reference distance was negatively 

correlated with the number of genes associated to lignin oxidation hemicellulose 

degradation ring cleavage pathway tripartite tricarboxylate transporting and the aahs 

transporters fig this suggests a potential reduction of the microbial gene repertoire 

related to lignin processing as the river approaches the ocean 

the gene machinery associated to the processing of lignin derived aromatic 

compounds was positively correlated to lignin oxidation along the river course fig 

suggesting a co processing of lignin and its byproducts lignin oxidation and hemicellulose 

degradation pathways were positively correlated fig supporting the idea that monomers 

of hemicellulose mainly carbohydrates could be priming lignin oxidation cellulose 

degradation was not correlated with lignin oxidation but had a weak positive correlation to 

hemicellulose degradation fig suggesting a coupling between both pathways 

we did not find correlations between the different types of funneling pathways 

 fp dimers and fp monomers and the linear geographic distance along the river course 

 fig this indicates that the degradation of lignin derived aromatic compounds was not 

restricted to any river section moreover the number of genes related to hemi cellulose 

degradation was positively correlated to lignin derived aromatic compounds degradation

pathways revealing a potential co metabolism of lignin derived compounds and hemi 

 cellulose degradation instead of lignin oxidation 

 

transporters 

lignin derived aromatic compounds need to be transported from the extracellular 

environment to the cytoplasm prior to their degradation transporters that could be associated 

to lignin degradation mfs transporter aahs family and abc transporters were found in 

the amnrgc while transporters from the mhs family its superfamily and trap could not 

be found mfs transporters were not correlated to any of the other examined pathways 

aahs transporters were negatively correlated to linear geographic distance while the other 

transporter families did not show any type of correlation with distance fig furthermore 

aahs and abc transporters showed positive correlations to the funneling pathway of 

monoaryls suggesting their transport by those transporter families abc transporters were 

positively correlated to o demethylation and c metabolism while aahs and abc 

transporters were correlated to the ring cleavage pathway this suggests that abc and aahs 

transporters are relevant for the metabolism of monoaryls derived from lignin oxidation 

the tripartite tricarboxylate transporting ttt system was correlated to the 

processing of allochthonous organic material in the amazon river three proteins compose 

this system where one is responsible of capturing substrates in the extracellular space and 

bringing them to the transporting channel made by the other two proteins which recognize 

the substrate binding protein and internalize the substrate interestingly there is a huge 

diversity associated to the substrate binding proteins since each protein is specific to one or a 

few substrates furthermore the ttt system displayed a negative correlation with the linear 

geographic distance suggesting its predominance in freshwaters sections fig

the ttt system was positively correlated to aahs and abc transporters fig 

suggesting functional complementarity as the ttt would transport substrates not transported 

by the other transporter families furthermore the ttt transporters showed a positive 

correlation with lignin oxidation and hemicellulose degradation suggesting either the 

transport of the products of those processes by ttt family or a dependence of compounds 

transported by it 

 

discussion 

 

the amnrgc represents the first inland tropical water non redundant microbial gene 

catalogue it allowed us to expand considerably our comprehension of the world’s largest 

river microbiome half of the millions genes in the amnrgc had no orthologs 

suggesting gene novelty yet there is limited information about the gene repertoire in other 

rivers preventing exhaustive comparisons the analysis of k mers indicated a distinct 

metagenomic composition in the amazon river basin when compared to other rivers and to 

the amazon rainforest soil this suggests that evolutionary processes may have generated 

such diversity via local adaptation although more samples from other rivers throughout the 

world would be necessary to test this hypothesis fully 

as expected cog functions within the superclass “metabolism” were the most 

abundant in the amnrgc as well as in the upper mississippi river a large fraction of these 

functions likely represents “core functional traits” shared across the tree of life this was 

supported by the similar distribution of cogs along different sections of the amazon river 

which also points to “core functional traits” that are conserved throughout the river course a 

set of core functions was also reported for the mississippi river as well as for the global 

ocean

we observed a subset of gene functions present in fresh and brackish water 

sections pointing to common core functions present along the amazon river basin yet 

other genes displayed a heterogeneous distribution pointing to salinity as a structuring 

variable salinity is known to affect microbial spatiotemporal distribution and jumps across 

the salinity barrier are rare evolutionary events the plume section displayed higher gene 

diversity than the ocean probably reflecting the coalescence of freshwater and marine 

microbial communities and their different genes 

core functions included a general carbohydrate metabolism and several transporter 

systems mainly abc transporters this suggests a sophisticated machinery to process teom 

in the amazon river where teom degradation appears more related to acetogenic and 

methanotrophic pathways this agrees with previous findings indicating a high expression 

of c metabolism genes methane monooxygenase mmob and formaldehyde activating 

enzyme fae the non core pathways suggest adaptations to a complex environment 

including multiple genes related to xenobiotic biodegradation and secondary metabolism that 

is the production and consumption of compounds not directly related to cell survival 

lignin derived aromatic compounds need to be transported from the extracellular 

milieu to the cytoplasm to be degraded and different transporting systems can be involved in 

this process in particular previous studies showed that the ttt system was present in 

high quantities in the amazon river and this was attributed to a potential degradation of 

allochthonous organic matter recent findings also suggest a ttt system related to the 

transport of teom degradation byproducts little is known about these transporters but 

our findings indicate that ttt is an abundant protein family in the amazon river suggesting 

that tricarboxylates are a common carbon source for prokaryotes in these waters our results 

suggest that the ttt transporters could be linked to lignin oxidation and hemicellulose 

degradation supporting their role in teom degradation

based in our findings we propose a model of the potential priming effect acting in 

ligno cellulose complexes from the amazon river fig in this model there are two 

different communities co existing in a consortium one responsible for hemi cellulose 

degradation and another one responsible for lignin degradation the first community releases 

extracellular enzymes mainly glucosyl hydrolases from families gh and gh whose 

reaction produces carbohydrates these sugars can provide structural carbon and energy for 

themselves and for the lignin degrader community the lignolytic community can also use 

the cellulolytic byproducts to growth promoting an oxidative metabolism this oxidative 

metabolism triggers the production and secretion of reactive oxygen species ros ros are 

then used by dyps and laccases secreted by lignolytic communities to oxidize lignin 

exposing more hemi cellulose to cellulolytic communities and re starting the cycle another 

important role of lignolytic communities is the degradation of lignin derived aromatic 

compounds generated by the lignin oxidation if those compounds are not degraded they 

could inhibit cellulolytic enzymes and microbial growth – preventing teom degradation 

this cycle may be considered as a priming effect where both communities benefit from each 

other

several substrate binding proteins tctc belonging to the tripartite tricarboxylate transporter 

 ttt system were related to the transporting of teom degradation byproducts like 

adipate and terephtalate to investigate the metabolism of these compounds and the 

possible link between the ttt system and lignin cellulose degradation the protein families

inner membrane periplasm or outer membrane we carried out predictions in the three 

possible taxa gram negative gram positive and archaea and the best score was used to 

determine the subcellular localization genes assigned to an “unknown” location as well as 

those with a wrong assignment were eliminated for example genes known to work in

figure priming effect model of microbial teom degradation in the amazon river 

the cellulolytic communities degrade hemi cellulose through secretion of glucosyl 

hydrolases mainly gh gh which releases sugars to the environment these sugars can 

promote growth in the cellulolytic and lignolytic communities and during this process the 

oxidative metabolism produces reactive oxygen species ros ros activate the exoenzymes 

 mainly through dyps and laccases secreted by the lignolytic community to oxidize lignin 

after lignin oxidation the hemi cellulose becomes exposed again helping the cellulolytic 

communities to degrade it during the previous process several aromatic compounds are 

formed which can potentially inhibit cellulolytic enzymes and microbial growth however 

these compounds are consumed by lignolytic microorganisms reducing their concentration in 

the environment allowing decomposition to proceed legend green arrows – feedback red 

dashed arrow – priming effect black dashed arrow – products magenta arrows – release of 

exoenzymes over a substrate gray arrow – inhibition that cellulolytic organisms suffer from 

byproducts of lignin oxidation
