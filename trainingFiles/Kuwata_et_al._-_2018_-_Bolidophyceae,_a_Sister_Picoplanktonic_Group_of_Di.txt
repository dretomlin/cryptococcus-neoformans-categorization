pico and nano phytoplankton respectively – and – µm in cell size play
a key role in many marine ecosystems in this size range bolidophyceae is a
group of eukaryotes that contains species with cells surrounded by or silica
plates parmales as well as naked flagellated species formerly bolidomonadales 
bolidophyceae share a common ancestor with diatoms one of the most successful
groups of phytoplankton this review summarizes the current information on taxonomy 
phylogeny ecology and physiology obtained by recent studies using a range of
approaches including metabarcoding despite their rather small contribution to the
phytoplankton communities on average less than bolidophyceae are very
widespread throughout marine systems from the tropics to the pole this review
concludes by discussing similarities and differences between bolidophyceae and
diatoms

very little diversified at the least at the genus level with a couple
of taxa prochlorococcus synechococcus dominating eukaryotes
turned out to be very diverse with picoplankton taxa distributed
widely across several branches of eukaryotic tree of life vaulot
et al 

microphytoplankton such as diatoms dinoflagellates or
coccolithophorids that produce short lived blooms such as
emiliania huxleyi have been extensively investigated in
contrast to other members of the picoplanktonic community 
a large number of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes species and
clades described to date belong to stramenopiles also called
heterokonts which are characterized by flagellated cells 
produced at least at some point of their life cycles with two
unequal flagella heterokont one being ornamented with hair 
like structures called mastigonemes their plastids are thought
to have been acquired through secondary endosymbiosis and
typically contain chlorophylls a and c stramenopiles besides
include diatoms a very successful lineage which cells are encased
in ornamented silica structures dictyochophyceae also called
silicoflagellates and pelagophyceae well known because of
the toxic algal blooms of the brown tide species aureococcus
anophagefferens and aureoumbra lagunensis gobler and sunda 
 or pelagomonas calceolata frequently isolated from
sea water although often seen as less diverse some of these
groups play important ecological roles in marine ecosystems are
fundamental for our understanding of the evolution of algae 

bolidophyceae a class created by guillou et al a is
the stramenopiles group phylogenetically nearest to the diatoms 
they are often detected in molecular surveys although in low
abundance we now know that they can occur as two distinct
forms either silicified pico sized – µm or non silicified
flagellated – µm cells guillou et al a ichinomiya
et al and cultures from both forms have been
isolated from the marine environment this review summarizes
the discovery of bolidophyceae and current information of
phylogeny ecology and physiology obtained by recent studies
using a range of approaches we discuss similarities and
differences between bolidophyceae and diatoms to explore the
evolutionary link between these silicified algal groups 

discovery and taxonomy

well before the creation of the class bolidophyceae their silicified
forms figure were first reported from scanning electron
microscopy sem images in oceanic samples from the north
pacific iwai and nishida initially they were thought
to be resting cysts of silicified loricate choanoflagellates silver
et al however the observation of red auto fluorescence
indicating the presence of chlorophyll and the existence of a
chloroplast in sectioned cells observed by transmission electron
microscopy revealed that they were active phytoplankton cells

 marchant and mceldowney marchant and mceldowney
 could not establish their taxonomic position although
they suggested some morphological similarities with other algae
groups such as bacillariophyceae and chrysophyceae 

booth and marchant tentatively established
parmales latin small round shields as a new order within
chrysophyceae the taxonomy of parmales was based on the
morphological features of silica plates that can only be observed
with sem two families and three genera were established 
pentalaminaceae with one genus pentalamina latin five
plates and triparmaceae with two genera tetraparma latin 
four small round shields and triparma latin three small
round shields figures a–c pentalamina has circular
shield plates of equal size a larger ventral plate and triradiate
girdle plates tetraparma has shield plates of equal size a
smaller ventral plate a triradiate dorsal plate and girdle plates 
triparma has shield plates of equal size a larger ventral

et al 

the flagellated forms of bolidophyceae figure d were
originally isolated from the pacific ocean and mediterranean sea 
and described as two flagellated species bolidomonas pacifica
and b mediterranea differing in the angle of the insertion of
the two flagellum swimming patterns as well as in s rrna
gene signatures guillou et al a the name “bolidomonas”
refers to the rapid swimming behavior of the cells remembering
a racing car a variety b pacifica var eleuthera was later
proposed based on both cultures and environmental sequences
 guillou et al b analyses of photosynthetic pigments as
well as nuclear s rrna and plastid rubisco large subunit
 rbcl sequences guillou et al a daugbjerg and guillou 
 demonstrated the sister relationship between bolidomonas
and diatoms although bolidomonas are flagellates and lack the
siliceous frustule characteristic of diatoms bolidophyceae were
thus proposed to be an intermediate group between diatoms and
all other stramenopiles guillou et al a 

for more than years parmales escaped isolation these
silicified cells are small and difficult to distinguish them from
other small phytoplankton in field samples under the light
microscope to overcome this problem ichinomiya et al 
 used the fluorescence dye pdmpo pyridyl 
 dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl methoxy phenyl 
oxazole shimizu et al which is co deposited with
silicon into the solid silica matrix of the newly produced cell
walls and fluoresces under uv excitation whenever silicic acid
is polymerized forming biogenic silica using pdmpo staining
and a serial dilution technique the first parmales strain was
established from oyashio region of the western north pacific
 ichinomiya et al 

scanning electron microscopy established that this strain
belonged to the species triparma laevis and transmission electron
microscope observations showed the typical ultrastructure of
photosynthetic stramenopiles with two endoplasmic reticulate
membranes surrounding the chloroplast a girdle and two to
three thylakoid lamellae as well as a mitochondrion with tubular

cristae phylogenetic analyses based on s ribosomal rrna
sequences from the new strain demonstrated that t laevis was
closely related to bolidophyceae ichinomiya et al rather
than part of chrysophyceae as hypothesized initially booth
and marchant phylogenetic analyses using plastidial and
mitochondrial encoded genes from t laevis also confirmed
its sistership with bolidophyceae and diatoms tajima et al 
 

recent phylogenetic analyses using nuclear plastidial and
mitochondrial genes from several novel strains including a
flagellate form very closely related to the silicified strains led
to a taxonomic revision table in which the order parmales
was included within the class bolidophyceae and bolidomonas
species were transferred to the genus triparma ichinomiya et al 
 

genetic diversity

clade diversity
the analysis of full length nuclear s rrna gene sequences
from public databases revealed the existence of two
environmental clades env clade i and ii in addition to
the group corresponding to the genus triparma ichinomiya
et al these clades are only formed by environmental
sequences and no sequences from cultures or isolates
are available within the triparma group sub clades
formed by sequences from strains and the environment
corresponded to the species triparma eleuthera triparma
pacifica and triparma mediterranea the “t laevis” sub 
clade including the species t laevis f inornata t laevis f 
longispina triparma strigata triparma aff verrucosa and the
flagellated strain triparma sp rcc other molecular
markers plastid s rrna and rbcl nuclear its rrna and
mitochondrial nad revealed the presence of two distinct
sub clades within the “t laevis” sub clade hereafter called
for convenience triparma clade i with the two forms of
t laevis f inornata and longispina and triparma clade ii
with t strigata t aff verrucosa and the flagellated strain
rcc 

in order to review the current state of the diversity of
bolidophyceae we analyzed existing genbank sequences
as well as metabarcodes obtained from a range of recent
studies table focusing on the v region of the s rrna
gene see supplementary material for methodology the
phylogenetic analysis of the newly obtained v sequences
 figure recovered the two major environmental clades
previously described env clade i and ii ichinomiya
et al but also revealed the existence of a third
environmental clade called env clade iii within which
two sub clades iiia and iiib can be clearly separated 
each environmental clade contained sequences from clone
libraries genbank as well as identical or nearly identical
metabarcode sequences from different surveys suggesting
that these environmental clades are not artefactual these
environmental clades may for some of them correspond
to species of parmales e g from genera tetraparma

the spacers between helices b and i i and ii ii and iii

helices i ii and iii in contrast the spacer between helices
iii and iv showed greater variation between bolidophyceae

on a base pair sequence comparison of all cbcs between
two sequences without direct reference to their evolutionary
origin müller et al coleman the phylogenetic
approach method which considers the status of a given base
pair in the ancestor of two sister taxon could not be applied
for bolidophyceae given the conflicting branching pattern among
phylogenies for more details see ichinomiya et al

supplementary figure helix iv figure was not included
in the inter clade analysis given its known variable nature
 coleman several cbcs and hcbcs were identified at

species figure 

at the intra clade level no cbc nor hcbcs were identified
between the two forms of t laevis f inornata and f longispina
 triparma clade i that differ by the plate morphology 
suggesting that these two forms may belong to the same species 
although the absence of cbcs is not an absolute indicator that
two organisms belong to the same species müller et al 
caisová et al however at least one cbc is a good
indicator of confidence for plants and fungi that in most
of the cases two organisms represent distinct species müller

ecology

oceanic distribution
we explored the distribution of bolidophyceae in the ocean using
data obtained by sem observation environmental sequencing
and metabarcoding by compiling available records of observed
silicified morphological species of bolidophyceae in natural
waters supplementary table we mapped the geographical
and specific distribution pattern of each morphological species
 figure tetraparma pelagica and the triparma species 
t laevis t columnacea t retinervis and t strigata are
widely distributed from polar to subtropical regions in contrast 
pentalamina corona tetraparma gracilis tetraparma catinifera 
and triparma verrucosa are restricted to polar or subpolar
regions t gracilis was observed in both arctic and antarctic
regions while p corona seems endemic to the antarctic and 
t verrucosa and t catinifera to the subarctic region tetraparma
insecta and the recently described species tetraparma silverae and
tetraparma trullifera seem to be restricted so far to subtropical
regions 

using both available environmental genbank sequences
and s rrna v metabarcodes acquired during the tara
oceans expedition ichinomiya et al established the

oceanic distribution of the major triparma species and of
environmental clades t mediterranea metabarcodes dominated
in the mediterranean sea while t pacifica and t eleuthera were
co dominant in the tropical and sub tropical oceans the t laevis
clade was clearly associated with cold antarctic waters but was
also found near the costa rica dome bolidophyceae sequences
were most abundant in the picoplanktonic fraction – µm 
of the tara oceans samples and represented at most of the
photosynthetic reads and less than on average ichinomiya
et al 

in order to obtain a more complete image of the
bolidophyceae distribution we used the large data set of
 s rrna v metabarcodes described above this data set
includes a range of studies table including osd ocean
sampling day that sampled an extensive set of coastal stations
 kopf et al and several from arctic and antarctic waters
that were not covered by the tara expedition 

among these metabarcodes the triparma clade was slightly
dominating in terms of total reads followed by the three
environmental clades iii i and ii respectively in this order
 figure a within triparma t pacifica was most abundant
followed by t mediterranea one environmental subclade iiia 
was also particularly abundant the relative contribution of

bolidophyceae to total metabarcodes at each station varied widely
with an average of figure b it was highest up to
 in both arctic and antarctic regions as well as around the
european coast in contrast bolidophyceae were absent at several
stations along the east coast of north america and in the eastern
mediterranean sea figure c 

the distribution of individual triparma species and
environmental clades confirmed some of the trends observed
in the tara oceans data ichinomiya et al but also
revealed new features figure among the triparma species 
t eleuthera and t pacifica were the most ubiquitous and
often co occurred at the same stations suggesting that their
ecological niches are very close they did not seem to be
present though in really polar waters such as in the beaufort
sea in contrast it was confirmed that t mediterranea was
indeed mostly restricted to the mediterranean sea while the
t laevis clade was only found at high latitudes both in the

arctic and antarctic some environmental clades had clear
biogeographic distributions such as clade iiia found mostly in
temperate latitudes and iiib only in the arctic and antarctic
regions the latter clade seemed particularly prevalent in
the high arctic ocean clade i was also mostly observed
at high latitudes although not restricted to polar waters 
in contrast to clade ii which was more widespread these
distribution patterns may reflect the genetic diversity within
these clades clades iiia and b have very low genetic diversity
 figure in contrast clades i or ii the former may therefore
correspond to a single species with a narrow niche and the
latter to several species or even genera explaining their wide
distribution

bolidophyceae actively grow during the cold mixing season
and maintain their population under the pycnocline during
the warm stratified season figure flagellated forms of

conclusion – the evolutionary
relationships between diatoms
and bolidophyceae

diatoms are highly diverse with to species
 mann and vanormelingen and constitute one of the
top group of primary producers contributing to about 
of the photosynthesis on earth the equivalent of terrestrial
rainforests nelson et al falkowski et al mann 
 they cover a wide size range from µm to mm
and form large blooms in high nutrient coastal and upwelling
systems margalef hasle and syvertsen they
are the main prey for zooplankton and the carbon that they
fix through photosynthesis is efficiently transferred to higher
trophic levels highlighted by their role in fish production
 ryther cushing from an evolutionary point of
view the appearance of this highly productive group and the
resulting increase in oceanic primary production may have
driven the evolution of crustaceans pelagic fish and whales
and shaped modern marine pelagic ecosystems parsons 
although the origin and early evolution of diatoms remain
controversial the first well–preserved diatom fossils have been
dated from ∼ myr ago in the early cretaceous gersonde
and harwood harwood and gersonde while

molecular clock based estimations suggest that the origin of
diatoms may have occurred – myr ago medlin 
 

recent multigene phylogenetic analyses suggest that
bolidophytes diatoms pelagophytes and dictyochophytes
form a monophyletic lineage riisberg et al yang
et al Ševèíková et al derelle et al this
lineage called diatomiista derelle et al or khakista
 riisberg et al originally only included diatoms and
bolidophytes cavalier smith and chao 

recent success in the isolation of strains of both silicified
and naked flagellated bolidophyceae species allow detailed
phylogenetic studies clarifying the taxonomic position of this
group as a sister group of diatoms and revealing the close
relationship between silicified and naked strains cell wall
formation and mitotic division in the silicified species t laevis
f inornata have intermediate features between diatom and more
ancient stramenopiles figure and tables analysis
of organellar genomes of this species also suggested that it
displays more ancestral characteristics than diatoms tajima
et al gene contents of the plastid and mitochondrial
genomes are similar between t laevis f inornata and diatoms
whereas the gene order of the mitochondrial genome is different 
the structure of the mitochondrial genome is also more compact
in t laevis f inornata than in diatoms since the latter species has
no introns or repeat regions which are often observed in some
diatoms species oudot le secq and green 

the phylogenetically close relationship between silicified and
naked bolidophyceae strains and recent occasional observation
of flagellated cells in cultures of t laevis f inornata ichinomiya
et al suggest that bolidophytes may have a life cycle
that switches between silicified non flagellated and naked

flagellate stages this hypothetical life cycle has similarities to
centric diatoms for which the diploid vegetative stage produces
haploid naked flagellated cells male gametes or spermatozoa 
during sexual reproduction drebes vaulot and chisholm 
 the origin early evolution and key processes for the
acquisition of the silica cell wall are not yet been fully
understood and bolidophyceae could play a key role in answering
these questions more comprehensive analyses including whole
genome sequences observations of the life cycle and fossil
records would lead a deeper understanding of the evolutionary
relationships between bolidophyceae and diatoms
