abstract
soil microbial communities undergo rapid shifts following modifications in environmental

conditions although microbial diversity changes may alter soil functioning the in situ tem 
poral dynamics of microbial diversity is poorly documented here we investigated the

response of fungal and bacterial diversity to wheat straw input in a months field experi 

ment and explored whether this response depended on the soil management history grass 

land vs cropland seasonal climatic fluctuations had no effect on the diversity of soil

communities contrastingly fungi and bacteria responded strongly to wheat regardless of

the soil history after straw incorporation diversity decreased due to the temporary domi 

nance of a subset of copiotrophic populations while fungi responded as quickly as bacteria 

the resilience of fungal diversity lasted much longer indicating that the relative involvement

of each community might change as decomposition progressed soil history did not affect

the response patterns but determined the identity of some of the populations stimulated 

most strikingly the bacteria burkholderia lysobacter and fungi rhizopus fusarium were
selectively stimulated given the ecological importance of these microbial groups as

decomposers and or plant pathogens such regulation of the composition of microbial suc 

cessions by soil history may have important consequences in terms of soil carbon turnover

and crop health 

introduction
soils are highly complex heterogeneous matrices which shelter a huge diversity of organisms
 with thousands of different species hosted per gram of soil microbial communities
account for a large part of this biodiversity as a major component of the biosphere soil
also offers a support for plant and animal development human activities and is directly
exposed to variations in climatic conditions it is consequently a dynamic environment and

there is a considerable body of evidence that soil microbial diversity responds strongly to
changes in soil conditions – 

one key example is the pattern of microbial community dynamics induced by the addition
of organic compounds such as plant debris into the soil – many studies have indeed
reported a progressive and orderly pattern of community development as regards the concept
of species succession commonly employed to explain community dynamics in above ground
terrestrial plant communities most of the community changes occur during the first
month after the input mainly attributed to fast growing copiotrophic populations that take
advantage of the readily degradable c compounds i e soluble compounds cellulose hemicel 
lulose in the plant residues subsequently more specialized slow growing popula 
tions develop on the remaining recalcitrant c compounds i e lignin due to their greater
catabolic capacities compared to the early stimulated populations such patterns
of diversity dynamics have been demonstrated for bacteria and fungi in addition 
since bacteria are assumed to harbor lower capacities for decomposing recalcitrant compounds
than fungi it is generally accepted that bacteria dominate the initial stages of decomposi 
tion whereas fungi dominate the later stages – however this is mainly based on quanti 
tative estimates of bacterial and fungal communities in contrast studies addressing the
response of the taxonomic composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities to plant resi 
dues addition are scarce and the relative contribution of bacterial vs fungal diversity to the dif 
ferent stages of plant residues decomposition remains poorly documented 

in addition while many studies have shown that land use management – as well as
plant litter quality i e initial c n ratio lignin content etc are important drivers
of soil microbial diversity in a given soil it is not known if the response of soil microbial com 
munities to the addition of a fixed quality of plant residue depends on the soil’s history this
question is however of major importance since the intensity of the decomposition process and
the resulting ecosystem services may depend on the diversity of the microbial populations
responding to the input 

the aim of this study was to investigate the importance of soil management history in the
response of the taxonomic diversity of bacterial and fungal communities to the incorporation
of wheat straw for this a field experiment was set up at the long term observatory of lusignan
 france briefly the site was composed of two adjacent plots each with a particular land use
history years grassland vs years cropland each plot was subdivided into sub plots 
three of which were amended with wheat residues while the other three represented
unamended controls following wheat addition the dynamics of microbial diversity fungal
and bacterial was followed in each sub plot over a one year period by high throughput
sequencing of ribosomal genes the site was kept vegetation free throughout the experiment to
avoid an additional response of microbial communities to plant development to our knowl 
edge this is the first study of the fine in situ characterization of the response of bacterial and
fungal diversity to seasonal climatic fluctuations and plant residues addition in relation to the
soil’s land use history

pyrosequencing of s and s rrna gene sequences
bacterial and fungal diversities were determined at each sampling date for each triplicate treat 
ment amended and control of each land use history grassland and cropland by pyrose 
quencing of ribosomal genes for bacteria a s rrna gene fragment with sequence variability
and the appropriate size about bases for pyrosequencing was amplified by pcr using
primers f and r for fungi an s rrna gene fragment of about bases was ampli 
fied using primers fr and ff primers and pcr conditions were as described previously
 the pcr products were purified using a minelute gel extraction kit qiagen courtaboeuf 
france and quantified using the picogreen staining kit molecular probes paris france a
second pcr of cycles was then conducted under similar pcr conditions with purified pcr
products and ten base pair multiplex identifiers added to the primers at ’ position to specifi 
cally identify each sample and avoid pcr bias finally the pcr products were purified and
quantified as previously described pyrosequencing was then carried out on a gs flx tita 
nium roche sequencing system 

bioinformatics analysis of s and s rrna gene sequences
bioinformatics analyses were done using the gns pipe developed by the genosol platform
 inra dijon france and initially described by terrat et al first all reads were sorted
according to the chosen identifiers sequences the raw reads were then filtered and deleted
based on their a length b number of ambiguities ns and c primer s sequence s 
perl programs were then applied to obtain strict dereplication alignment of reads using infer 
nal alignments and clustered at sequence similarity into operational taxonomic units
 otu that cluster rare reads with abundant ones and do not count differences in homopoly 
mer lengths another homemade filtering step was then applied to eliminate potential sources
of errors e g pcr chimeras sequencing errors otu overestimation in order to efficiently
compare the datasets and avoid biased community comparisons the samples reads were
reduced by random selection closed to the lowest datasets and reads for s and
 s rrna gene sequences respectively the retained high quality reads were used for i tax 
onomy independent analyses to determine diversity indices using the defined otu composi 
tion and ii taxonomy based analysis using similarity approaches against dedicated reference
databases from silva r for s and r for s the raw data sets are available on the
ebi database system under project accession number prjeb 

statistical analysis
differences in microbial communities structure between control and wheat incorporated plots
within a given land use history were characterized using unifrac distances non metric
multidimensional scaling nmds was used to graphically depict differences between micro 
bial communities analysis of similarity anosim permutations was used to test the sig 
nificance of the observed clustering of samples on the ordination plot according to soil history 
the difference in change of the microbial communities in response to wheat straw between the
two land use histories was interpreted as the magnitude of the unifrac distance between the
control and the amended plots for each sampling date and was calculated as follows magnitude
of modifications for each sampling date and land use history average of inter unifrac dis 
tances control plots soil incorporated plots – average of intra unifrac distances control

lowed by a slowdown and resilience of community modification the community changes
peaked after days for both bacteria and fungi whatever the soil history fig as observed for
the diversity indices however the amplitude of the structural modifications was greater for
fungi than for bacteria and resilience of the community structure occurred more rapidly for
bacteria days than for fungi days although the time of occurrence did not depend
on the land use history fig 

despite the similar community response patterns figs and the community structures
 bacterial and fungal at each sampling date could still be clearly discriminated between the
two soils grassland vs cropland indicating that different communities were stimulated by
wheat residues fig this observation was confirmed by the taxonomic compositions at the
phyla and genera levels fig s and s figs some microbial phyla responded similarly to
wheat addition fig in the two soils thus proteobacteria and the group of sequences
“unclassified” to fungal phyla were both strongly increased during the early stage following res 
idues input other bacterial phyla such as nitrospira verrumicrobia acidobacteria actino 
bacteria and planctomycetes were decreased as well as the fungal phyla basidiomycota 
chytridiomycota and glomeromycota in addition to these “shared response” groups some
phyla responded specifically according to the soil history for example the early increase of
fibrobacteres from to days following wheat addition occurred only in the cropland soil
whereas synergistetes and bacteroidetes increased much later from to days following
wheat addition and only in grassland soil in the same way ascomycota increased mainly in
the grassland soil throughout the experiment analysis of taxonomic composition at the genera
level provided complementary information to the phyla data for instance the general increase
in proteobacteria was mainly explained by the stimulation of pseudomonas andmassilia 
whereas lysobacter only increased in the cropland soil and burkholderia only increased in
grassland soil fig similarly the group of sequences “unclassified” to fungal phyla which
represented the principal group of stimulated fungal sequences regardless of soil history 
mainly consisted of populations affiliated tomucor for which the relative abundance increased
throughout the experiment mortierella which also increased in both soils but just from day
 to day and rhizopus which increased strongly in cropped soil but not in grassland soil

discussion
bacterial and fungal diversity and composition differed according to the soil management his 
tory grassland vs cropland as reported in previous studies in addition discrimina 
tion between the two soils remained stable throughout the one year experiment highlighting
the long lasting nature of the changes induced by past land use since the site was
kept weed free it is likely that the differences in soil properties accounted for a large part of the
microbial communities discrimination between the two soils – while soil texture was
similar as expected because of the vicinity of the two plots soil chemical properties differed
between the grassland and cropland soils thus soc and soil nitrogen content were higher 
and ph lower in the grassland soil in agreement with other studies accordingly 
microbial groups previously described as mainly copiotrophic such as proteobacteria 
or acidophilic such as acidobacteria were more represented in the grassland soil than
in the cropland soil where oligotrophic groups such as gemmatimonadetes were more repre 
sented in addition ascomycota one of the most dominant fungal groups in cultivated
soils dominated the fungal community in the cropland soil contrastingly the abun 
dance of basidiomycota and actinobacteria both described as k strategists being favored in

more stable systems such as forest and natural grassland was increased in the
grassland soil 

in the controls neither bacterial nor fungal diversity i e richness and evenness nor com 
position varied significantly during the one year period despite the climatic variations that
occurred at the experimental site s fig this contrasted with lauber and colleagues who
evidenced a significant in situ temporal variability of bacterial communities over a month
period these authors showed however that a large proportion of the seasonal variations in
bacterial diversity could be explained by the diversity and dynamics of plant cover and the sub 
sequent regulation of c inputs i e root exudates and plant litter thus the observed stability
of microbial diversity in our study might be explained by the exclusion of plants interestingly 
this suggests that under a buffered oceanic climate as is the case at our experimental site the
dynamics of plant cover rather than climatic variations may shift microbial diversity during
the seasons 

soil microbial diversity responded strongly to wheat straw incorporation in agreement with
many other studies focused on the impact of plant litter on soil microbial communities
 microbial richness and evenness indices showed a transient decrease following

amendment due to the early stimulation of a subset of fast growing bacterial and fungal popu 
lations developing on the most easily decomposable straw compounds this was in
agreement with the patterns of community structure that were characterized by an initial early
and highly dynamic phase followed by a second phase of slower variations leading to a resil 
ience and stability of both bacterial and fungal communities structure it is noteworthy that for
a given community i e bacteria or fungi in spite of initial differences in terms of diversity
and composition neither the variations in diversity indices nor the patterns of community
structure differed according to the soil management history however the kinetics and ampli 
tude of community response did differ between bacteria and fungi surprisingly the peak in
communities’modification for both bacteria and fungi occurred three days after the input 
indicating that fungi may be as competitive as bacteria for fast development on freshly incorpo 
rated wheat straw this is not in agreement with the commonly accepted idea that differences
in physiology and metabolic capacities between bacteria and fungi may confer an advantage to
bacteria over fungi during the early stages of decomposition however recent stud 
ies using c labelling of plants also showed that decomposer fungi may contribute signifi 
cantly to the decomposition of simple root exudates in addition the quality of the
wheat straw characterized by a high c n may also have contributed to the concomitant

early stimulation of bacterial and fungal populations as well as the greater amplitude of the
diversity modification observed for fungi compared to bacteria indeed fungi are known to be
better equipped than bacteria for decomposing recalcitrant organic c compounds – and
the decomposability of the litter entering the soil is likely to be of major importance in deter 
mining the sequential stimulation of bacteria and fungi during the early phase of decomposi 
tion in other respects the better enzymatic abilities of fungal populations may explain why
fungal communities responded up to days whereas modifications of the bacterial commu 
nities occurred only during the first month days after wheat addition this slower resil 
ience of fungal diversity as compared to that of bacteria suggests that fungi may dominate the
latter stages of wheat straw decomposition 

while the patterns of bacterial and fungal diversity indices and communities structure were
similar regardless of soil history some of the populations entering the successions differed 
several bacterial phyla such as nitrospira verrumicrobia acidobacteria and planctomycetes 
were decreased by wheat straw incorporation which was in agreement with other studies
showing that these phyla are probably mainly composed of oligotrophic slow growing popula 
tions in addition nitrospira underrepresentation might also be response of reduc 
tion of nitrogen availability due to high c n material input contrastingly bacteroidetes were
stimulated by wheat straw but in the latter stages of wheat decomposition i e months after
wheat addition in agreement with previous results the proteobacteria phylum was
increased rapidly regardless of the soil history as reported previously this global
increase was mainly due to the stimulation of two genera occurring in both soils pseudomonas
andmassilia that had previously been described as mainly copiotrophic bacteria being stimu 
lated by inputs of wheat straw or more soluble c compounds interestingly in addi 
tion to these genera burkholderia was enhanced only in the soil with a grassland history
whereas lysobacter was enhanced only in the soil with a cropland history recent studies also
reported stimulation of burkholderia species by plant residue inputs into the soil probably
because of the strong catabolic versatility of these species which enables them to degrade a
wide range of c compounds including cellulose since this genus is also known to be
closely associated with plants in the rhizosphere it is likely that the long grassland history 
characterized by permanent plant cover with a very dense root network may have led to the
selection of a particular diversity of burkholderia species compared to the adjacent cropland 
hence explaining the observed discrepancy between the responses of the two soils however 
differential stimulation of this genusmay be of significance for subsequent crops since many
burkholderia species are associated with plants in positive i e growth promoting species or
negative i e pathogens interactions similarly to burkholderia lysobacter is known to
possess strong lytic abilities to degrade various biomacromolecules however this genus
has also been shown to decrease with decreasing soil ph which may explain why stimula 
tion was observed in the cropland soil ph but not in the grassland soil ph alto 
gether these results suggest that the modulation in diversity of the populations responding to
plant litter input according to the past history of the soil may be determined either by the
actual soil properties or by the diversity of the decomposers resulting from past interactions
with plant cover 

regarding the fungal communities the observed initial decrease of the diversity indices was
due to the massive increase ofmortierella which represented up to and of the
sequences identified at t in the cropland and grassland soils respectively this strong stimu 
lation observed only three days after wheat straw incorporation suggests that this genusmay
be as competitive as bacteria in decomposing the most decomposable straw c compounds 
this is in agreement with other reports thatmortierella are fast growing fungi developing on
substrates rich in simple carbohydrates in addition their ability to produce chitinolytic

enzymes may make them successful competitors among other fungi which could explain
their massive and exclusive development observed at t nevertheless this competitive advan 
tage may be limited to decomposition of the most soluble wheat compounds sincemortierella
decreased from t and was replaced by a diversity of other newly stimulated fungi as for bac 
teria some of these new populations were shared or specifically stimulated depending on the
soil history for example mucor and chaetomium were stimulated in both soils from t and
throughout the year of experimentation in agreement with their known contribution to plant
debris decomposition in soil due to their cellulolytic hemicellulolytic and lignolytic abilities
 the genus sarocladium was also stimulated in both soils but only transiently with a
peak observed at t interestingly two fungal genera responded specifically depending on the
soil history most strikingly rhizopus was very weakly represented in the controls of both soils 
but responded strongly and lastingly to wheat straw incorporation in the cropland soil repre 
senting up to of the sequences identified but not in the grassland soil this genus is a com 
mon soil mold which develops on decomposing plant litter in soil however we cannot
explain why it only responded in the cropland soil it is possible that this selective stimulation
could be of significance for the health of subsequent crops since some rhizopus species are
described as plant pathogens in contrast to rhizopus fusarium was one of the dominant
fungi in both soils and was strongly stimulated in the grassland soil but not in the cropland
soil this genus is known be saprophytic widely distributed in soil and often associated with
plant debris a similar stimulation of fusarium populations following crop residues incor 
poration and the strong influence of the residues composition on the structure of the fusarium
community has already been reported here we show that the stimulation of fusarium
by plant residues may also depend on the past use of the soil in addition to potential repercus 
sions in terms of carbon mineralization this differential stimulation between the two soils may
have consequences for subsequent crops since some of the fusarium species are strongly asso 
ciated with several diseases that cause crop yield losses and mycotoxin contamination of grain
 however since all fusarium species are not pathogenic additional determination of
fusarium diversity at the species level would now be needed to determine whether populations
differentially stimulated were pathogenic or not 

this study provides new insights into the in situ dynamics of the diversity of bacterial and
fungal communities in soil it shows that seasonal fluctuations of climatic conditions may have
little impact on the diversity of these communities while long term differences in land use
management impacted soil microbial diversity they did not affect the patterns of community
response to wheat straw incorporation in terms of diversity indices and community structure
variations fungal diversity responded as quickly as bacterial diversity but the resilience of fun 
gal communities lasted longer which would indicate that whereas bacteria and fungi may both
play a major role during the initial stages fungi may dominate the latter stages of wheat
decomposition despite similar response patterns the identity of some of the bacterial and fun 
gal populations in the successions was dependent on soil history among the specifically stimu 
lated populations were bacterial and fungal populations of particular ecological importance 
such as burkholderia or fusarium both recognized for their involvement in the decomposition
of organic matter but also for their impact on crops health this effect of soil history on popu 
lation successions during the decomposition of a given quality of plant litter had not been evi 
denced previously it is however of major importance since it highlights that the diversity of
microbial decomposers may be driven by soil management history with potential conse 
quences in terms of plant residues decomposition a transformation of significance for the c 
balance in the soil environment
