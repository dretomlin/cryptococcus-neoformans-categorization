abstract

aims the aim of this work was to investigate the effects of biodynamic

management with and without the addition of green manure in comparison

with organic management on the microbiota in vineyards soil 

methods and results high throughput sequencing was used to compare the

taxonomic structure of the soil bacterial and fungal communities from

vineyards managed with different methods organic biodynamic or

biodynamic with green manure our results showed that microbial

communities associated with biodynamic and organic farming systems were

very similar while green manure was the greatest source of soil microbial

biodiversity and significantly changed microbial richness and community

composition compared with other soils green manure also significantly

enriched bacterial taxa involved in the soil nitrogen cycle e g microvirga sp 

pontibacter sp and nitrospira sp 

conclusions our results showed that the diversity and composition of the

microbial communities associated with biodynamic and organic farming

systems were similar indicating that the use of biodynamic preparations 

and did not cause any significant detectable changes to the soil microbial

community in the short term while the effects of green manure were

significant in soil microbiota 

significance and impact of the study the microbiological richness and

structure of soil are used as a sensitive indicator of soil quality the extension

of organic biodynamic farming associated with green manure application 

could contribute to increase the abundance of functional groups of biological

and agronomical relevance and maintaining microbial biodiversity in vineyard

soils 

introduction

since there are vineyards dating back to pre roman times

in europe the grapevine offers a unique opportunity to

study extremely long term monocultures schlegel 

the physical and chemical properties of soil generally

have a major effect in shaping the microbial population

of vineyard soil corneo et al compared with

other agro ecosystems vineyard soils receive lower nitro 

gen fertilizer input and are subjected to relatively infre 

quent tilling and fewer herbicide applications which may

be reflected in the composition of microbial communities

 steenwerth et al however in recent years grape 

growing areas have been subjected to cropping intensifi 

cation thus traditional vineyards planted along the con 

tours of hills on small terraces have often been

abandoned and replaced by larger plots on low to moder 

ate slopes with chemical fertilization and weed control 

which increases grape production but also intensifies soil

degradation lopez pineiro et al indeed in terms

of biochemical properties vineyard soils are usually

highly degraded miguens et al long term use of

certain inorganic pesticides in particular copper based

fungicides has resulted in increased concentrations of

heavy metals in the soil affecting the environmental

compartments of soil komarek et al many

studies have demonstrated that conventional agricultural

practices can significantly impact microbial communities

in soil ecosystems villanueva rey et al hartmann

et al although the grapevine is an important crop

worldwide and preserving the biological quality of soil is

mandatory for sustainable agriculture knowledge about

soil microbiological processes in vineyards is generally

limited probst et al 

the addition of organic substances is of vital impor 

tance for soil quality and health baldi et al 

organic fertilizers can be a good solution for maintaining

soil health since the release of nutrients in soil is slower

than for chemical fertilizers and often better matches

plant needs in the growing season of the different

organic fertilizers green manure consists of growing

specific crops in the inter rows of the vineyard and then

ploughing them into the terrain to improve soil quality 

green manure crops usually include grass mixtures and

legume plants such as vetch clover barley and others 

multiple benefits are produced by green manure the

physical structure of soil is improved because green

manure tends to reduce soil erosion and leaching ingels

et al this practice can also help to provide eco 

logical niches supporting predators parasitoids improving

pest control in the vineyard irvin et al green

manure influences the grapevine plant and its fruit by

enhancing the organoleptic characteristics of the grapes

 rotaru et al moreover the organic carbon avail 

able for soil micro organisms is significantly increased by

green manure which also enhances the activity of numer 

ous soil enzymes especially those involved in the n cycle

 okur et al although the advantages of using

green manure have been recognized little is known about

the possible modifications that it could cause in soil

microbial communities 

organic agriculture is codified by the council of the

european union ec as a management that

uses living organisms and mechanical production meth 

ods excludes the use of genetically modified organisms

 gmo and the products derived from them reduces the

external inputs that are limited to natural or naturally

derived substances and bans the use of chemically syn 

thesized inputs biodynamic agriculture can be regarded

as a pioneer version of organic agriculture kirchmann

 and it is currently a certification and labelling sys 

tem included in the organic production the principles

of biodynamic agriculture were established in germany

by rudolf steiner in the s it adopts a holistic

approach to the exploitation of natural resources taking

into consideration the sustainability of different elements 

such as the crops themselves animal life preservation or

the maintenance of high quality soil in order to recover 

preserve or improve ecological harmony the biodynamic

approach in farm practices reflects the metaphysical

concepts proposed by its founder it uses a set of specific

compost preparations to be applied to crops to aid fertil 

ization and the application of other homoeopathic treat 

ments based on infusions or plant extracts lotter 

whose effect did not received scientific validation so far

 chalker scott for example preparations and

 consist in cow manure and quartz powder respec 

tively placed in a cow horn and buried and then used in

the field after a period of maturation 

knowledge of how soil management affects soil micro 

bial species richness and abundance is important because

microbial diversity and stability determine the soil’s abil 

ity to react to external changes the impact and degrada 

tion munoz et al beneficial microbial processes

are essential for crop production as they determine the

soil’s ability to supply nutrients to the plant they retain

nutrients in the profile contribute to the formation of

soil structure suppress plant pathogens and contribute to

soil humus formation ingels et al

discussion

scientific studies on biodynamic management in vine 

yards and its effect on soil microbiota are rare burns

et al since most works tend to concentrate on the

effects on plants or grapes recent work on biodynamic

viticulture has affirmed that in terms of grape health the

microbiological and chemical characteristics in these

vineyards were comparable or better to those in vineyards

cultivated using conventional methods guzzon et al 

 

there are several theories regarding the way in which

the biodynamic preparations may interact with crops and

may include hormonal stimulation enhancing crop

growth especially at root level villanueva rey et al 

 as regards the effects of biodynamic preparations 

according to chalker scott the addition of these

products did not affect the yield of the crops analysed 

and other authors have also stated that biodynamic

preparations had little influence on plant biotic parame 

ters doring et al baskar and shanmugham 

we used the high resolution power of pyrosequen 

cing to investigate soil microbial biodiversity in sustain 

ably managed vineyards specifically studying the short 

term effects of two types of farming management o 

bd and green manure application bd bdgm on the

diversity richness and composition of soil microbial

communities in our study no difference in alpha or beta

diversity was noticed between o and bd soil samples 

this is in agreement with previous studies on biodynamic

management which have indicated similar behaviour for

organic and biodynamic farming systems in terms of

microbial soil composition and diversity in fact carpen 

ter boggs et al found that organically and biody 

namically managed soils had a similar microbial

composition but they were more biotically active than

soils that did not receive organic fertilization moreover 

organic management enhanced soil biological activity but

additional use of biodynamic preparations did not signifi 

cantly affect the soil biotic parameters tested in this

study we have to consider the short term exposure of

the soil microbiota to the different vineyard manage 

ments according to hartmann et al the short 

term effect of agricultural management has shown a fewer

impact than the long term effects mainly on bacterial

community and the spatiotemporal variability was impor 

tant to reveal the shift of the structure of the soil micro 

biota 

green manure application had a major impact on soil

micro organisms our results showed the crucial impor 

tance of green manure for soil microbiota since it pro 

moted higher bacterial richness and significant changes in

the microbial communities found in bdgm soils bacte 

ria and fungi responded in a similar way to green manure

application these results are in accordance with ingels

et al who analysed microbial communities using

phospholipid fatty acid plfa analysis showing that

biodynamic management associated with green manure

application increased the taxonomic and phylogenetic

richness diversity and heterogeneity of soil microbiota

some fungal otus such as the genus cladorrhinum a

fungal group of prime importance for agriculture and

livestock since some species have biocontrol potential or

have been shown to promote plant growth and produce

phytases carmaran et al and the cold adapted

nium persicinum an endophytic fungus of the grapevine

with antagonistic activity against both the asexual and

sexual spores of plasmopara viticola burruano et al 

 acremonium persicinum also hydrolyses cellulose

and produces cephalosporin c which is a major precur 

sor of semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotics used to

treat a wide range of bacterial infections sarookhani and

moazzami 

as regards the bacterial indicator species of bdgm

soils there were three bacterial genera involved in the soil

nitrogen cycle nitrospira sp paenibacillus sp and the

aforementioned nitrogen fixing pontibacter sp nitro 

spira sp belongs to nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 

 hayatsu et al and is widely distributed in many

habitats including soil oceans freshwater and wastewater

treatment plants koch et al in soil it is often

associated with an increased supply of nitrogen from

mineral fertilization zhou et al another nitro 

gen fixing bacterium is paenibacillus sp which is also

considered a plant growth promoter due to its production

of iaa indole acetic acid and it also has biocontrol

potential against grapevine pathogens such as botrytis

cinerea and neofusicoccum parvum grady et al 

haidar et al as regards fungi four black yeasts

 cladorrhinum sp capnobotryella sp cystofilobasidium

capitatum and exophiala were fungal indicator otus in

bdgm soils most of these genera are found as saprobes

colonizing inert surfaces or in hydrocarbon or heavy 

metal polluted habitats and several are potential human

pathogens seyedmousavi et al currently little

information about the ecophysiology of other detected

indicator otus catelliglobosispora sp planosporangium

sp and capnobotryella sp is available in order to deduce

any putative ecological role in the soil system two differ 

ent techniques that are commonly used to investigate the

differences in microbial communities indicator species

and otu identified by permutational anova detected

different groups of otus both techniques individuated

planosporangium sp and pontibacter sp as significant

bacterial otus in bdgm soils while no correspondences

were found in fungal otus these discrepancies in meth 

ods indicate how difficult can be a univocal characteriza 

tion of microbial communities since different valid

statistical tools can give different answers depending on

the algorithms applied for this reason we decided to

maintain and analyse both results in exploiting two dif 

ferent techniques of analysis 

arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi occur in the roots of

most plants and are an ecologically important component

of the soil microbiome analysis of the otus belonging

to glomeromycota showed a low level of amf relative

abundance also hartmann et al have observed

only few glomeromycota associated to different organic

and conventional management systems using pyrose 

quencing analysis according to orgiazzi et al 

ectomycorrhizal phylotypes are numerous in natural sites

covered by trees but they are almost completely lacking

in anthropogenic and grass covered sites ciccolini et al 

 on studying the community of amf with 

pyrosequencing reported a low level of amf richness in

intense cropping systems however we should also con 

sider the limited coverage by the primers used in this

work to be partly responsible for the few glomeromycota

observed stockinger et al the genus glomus was

most abundant and present in all soils in accordance

with other studies which have found this genus to be the

most abundant amf in the grapevine schreiner and

mihara 

soil is a nonrenewable resource and most vineyard

soils are considered to be highly degraded in terms of loss

of organic carbon as a result of a decrease in nutrient

content an accumulation of metals and organic

pollutants coll et al the effect of agricultural

management systems on soil micro organisms is generally

studied with plants undergoing rotation but less is

known about soils used for perennial plants such as the

grapevine this is one of the few works comparing the

microbial communities of soil in organic and biodynamic

vineyards using pyrosequencing overall our results

showed that the diversity and composition of the micro 

bial communities associated with biodynamic and organic

farming systems were similar indicating that the use of

biodynamic preparations and did not cause any

significant detectable changes to the soil microbial com 

munity in the short term while the effects of green man 

ure were significant in soil microbiota the increase in

soil microbial diversity associated with the use of green

manure could have possible benefits for plant nutrition 

considering that in organic farming systems mineraliza 

tion of organic matter depends on soil micro organism

activity the incorporation of green manure was shown

to increase the diversity of micro organisms in soil par 

ticularly the abundance of specific bacteria and fungi 

evidence of increased nitrogen fixing and nitrite oxidiz 

ing bacteria populations in soil as a response to the use

of green manure suggests that they can potentially be

adopted to increase nitrogen availability an extension of

organic biodynamic farming associated with green man 

ure application could contribute to maintaining higher

microbial biodiversity in vineyard soil and consequently

positively influence overall soil quality
