fixed inorganic nitrogen n is persistently scarce in the well lit regions of the subtropical

ocean gyres and its supply plays an important role in controlling phytoplankton

productivity in a series of experiments conducted in the north pacific subtropical gyre

 npsg we examined changes in primary productivity and eukaryotic phytoplankton

community structure in response to additions of nitrate no− ammonium nh
 
 or

urea in conjunction with phosphate and silicic acid overall we observed large increases

in rates of c primary productivity ∼ to fold and concentrations of chlorophyll

a ∼ to fold following n addition much of the physiological response was due to

larger µm phytoplankton whose contributions to primary productivity increased

∼ fold while picophytoplankton – µm contributions decreased by a similar

proportion five experiments conducted in the spring summer and winter revealed

apparent seasonally dependent responses in phytoplankton community structure to

n availability during the summer pennate diatoms increased significantly following n

addition as evidenced by both photosynthetic pigment analyses and high throughput

sequencing of s rdna for example following the addition of n substrates 

concentrations of fucoxanthin a diatom pigment biomarker increased between and

 fold and relative abundances of rrna genes belonging to pseudo nitzschia

increased from negligible ∼ to – of the µm phytoplankton assemblage 

however unlike the diatom driven responses observed in the summer experiments

conducted in the spring and winter demonstrated large increases in concentrations of

 ′ butanoyloxyfucoxanthin a pelagophyte pigment biomarker together with increases

in the relative abundance of rrna genes clustering among pelagomonas overall 

our findings revealed differences in the responses of major taxa during experiments

conducted in different times of the year with concomitant impacts on patterns of

phytoplankton diversity in addition the overall responses in chlorophyll a c primary

production and eukaryotic phytoplankton community composition appeared largely

independent of the type of n substrate added our results highlight seasonal scale

differences on the role of n availability in shaping eukaryotic phytoplankton diversity in

the surface waters of the oligotrophic npsg

rii et al eukaryotic phytoplankton response to nitrogen

introduction

in oligotrophic marine ecosystems such as the north pacific
subtropical gyre npsg less than of organic matter
produced is exported out of the euphotic zone as sinking
particles implying rapid organic matter turnover and nutrient
remineralization karl et al such low organic matter
export in these regions has been attributed to the restricted supply
of inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p 
to the euphotic zone karl arrigo concentrations
of nitrate nitrite n n and ammonium nh in the near 
surface waters of the npsg are typically and nm 
respectively wada and hattori karl et al hence 
competition for limiting n could be central to structuring the
productivity and diversity of planktonic communities in this
ecosystem 

n availability in the euphotic zone of the npsg varies on
seasonal event to interannual scales exerting important control
on plankton community succession primary productivity and
particulate matter export in this oligotrophic habitat seasonal
variability of nutrients in the euphotic zone is partly controlled
by variations in the penetration of light for example the
flux of light penetrating to the dimly lit regions of the
euphotic zone varies seasonally and as a result nitrate no− 
concentrations accumulate during the winter letelier et al 
 the accumulated nutrients are subsequently consumed
when the flux of light to the lower euphotic zone increases
during the spring letelier et al additionally episodic
to seasonal scale supply of no− to the lower euphotic zone can
occur through convective mixing and displacement of isopycnal
surfaces due to mesoscale processes such as eddies and planetary
waves dandonneau et al sakamoto et al johnson
et al in addition activities of n fixing microorganisms
increase during the warm stratified summer months church
et al increasing concentrations of dissolved organic n and
nh in the surface waters karl et al 

although picoplanktonic cyanobacteria are dominant
contributors to biomass and rates of gross primary production
in oligotrophic ocean ecosystems campbell et al karl 
 karl and church eukaryotic phytoplankton play
central roles in controlling material export net community
production and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems benitez 
nelson et al juranek et al alexander et al 
 in the npsg analyses of photosynthetic pigment
concentrations and quantification of cell abundances by
both microscopy and flow cytometry has revealed that major
taxa of eukaryotic phytoplankton distributed throughout the
upper ocean include diatoms haptophytes pelagophytes and
dinoflagellates bienfang and szyper campbell and
vaulot venrick cortés et al moreover 
distributions and abundances of these eukaryotic phytoplankton
are temporally and spatially variable fluctuating in response
to physical and chemical changes to the upper ocean habitat 
for example sampling of two cyclonic eddies with varying
rates of nutrient input as a result of spin up duration in the
oligotrophic waters southwest of the hawaiian islands revealed
disparities in major eukaryotic phytoplankton response within

each eddy with subsequent consequences in food web structure
and carbon export benitez nelson et al rii et al 
additionally observations at station aloha to the north of the
hawaiian islands have highlighted the important role of diatoms
in regulating carbon export karl et al notably peaks in
diatom driven export coincides with summertime periods when
rates of n fixation and biomass of n fixing cyanobacteria are
elevated dore et al villareal et al karl et al 

past studies have demonstrated preferential uptake of nh 
relative to no− by phytoplankton a finding hypothesized to
reflect the energetic savings in assimilating reduced forms of
n e g eppley et al dortch however various
field based studies have concluded that cyanobacteria and
eukaryotic phytoplankton in the oligotrophic oceans may rely
on different forms of n to support their growth fawcett
et al shilova et al such results highlight the
potential role for different forms of n in controlling time 
varying phytoplankton community structure to date however 
there is limited information available on how different taxa of
phytoplankton respond to changes in the availability and form
of n substrates 

in the current study we experimentally examined responses in
upper ocean primary productivity and eukaryotic phytoplankton
community structure to n enrichments at station aloha 
in five separate experiments natural seawater plankton
communities were treated with additions of no− or nh

 
 

 or urea in one experiment and sampled daily over a to
 hour period we sought to determine which eukaryotic
phytoplankton assemblages responded to the additions of
nitrogenous substrates and over what time scales providing
insight into how variations in the availability of nitrogenous
nutrients contribute to variability in phytoplankton community
structure and growth in the euphotic zone of oligotrophic
subtropical gyres

discussion

we conducted five experiments during the winter spring and
summer months between july to april to examine the
responses of the eukaryotic phytoplankton to additions of no− 

nh or urea along with po
 −
 and si oh we assessed

how the addition of varying nitrogenous substrates influenced
size dependent responses in rates of primary production and
concentrations of chl a and altered eukaryotic phytoplankton
community structure based on changes in concentrations of
photosynthetic pigments and analyses of s rdna sequences 
in three of the five experiments july and december 
and april rates of no− and nh

 
 drawdown were

roughly equivalent between the n addition treatments in
addition contributions of pico and larger phytoplankton to
 c primary production and chl a concentrations did not
differ significantly based on the type of n substrates added 
except for the experiment conducted in march in
march we observed a ∼ fold increase in c primary

production from the initial timepoint to h for the nh 
treatment concomitant with a greater response by diatoms in
the pico size fraction this disparity in response from other
experiments is likely due to the initial nh concentration
being ∼ x the target concentration as well as the initial no− 
concentration despite the greater enrichment ∼ of the
nh added was drawn down during this experiment the
different responses observed in this experiment may reflect
a concentration dependent response by the phytoplankton
assemblage rather than reflecting a difference in the types of
substrates added overall results from these five experiments
suggest that the oxidation state of the nitrogenous substrates
that we selected oxidized no− or reduced nh

 
 and urea 

did not play a major role in shaping rates of n drawdown
or the resulting size class responses of phytoplankton biomass
and productivity in a series of experiments in the oligotrophic
npsg shilova et al observed increases in rates of
primary production and phytoplankton biomass specifically by
cyanobacteria prochlorococcus following the addition of urea 
however consistent with the findings from the present study 
species composition and growth rates did not appear to be
influenced by the type of n source added eppley et al 
although previous studies comparing no− and nh

 
 strickland

et al eppley et al and urea newell et al 
demonstrated that elemental composition c n and c chl ratio
of phytoplankton changed depending on the form of n used for
growth

binned by winter spring and summer boxplot parameters are the same as described for figure 

although our experiments were not designed to examine
competition amongst phytoplankton for differing n substrates
 e g through simultaneous additions of both no− and nh

 
 

to the same treatment our results do provide insight into taxa
best poised to respond to relatively large changes in n availability
in this ecosystem two of our observations that the timing
and response of phytoplankton to both no− and nh

 
 were

similar and that no significant changes were observed in our
“control” carboys amended with only po − and si oh except
for∼ fold increase in photosynthetic eukaryote cell abundances
during the july experiment likely reflect the chronic n
limitation of the oligotrophic upper ocean waters of the npsg 
in these well lit upper ocean waters phytoplankton production
is consistently light saturated li et al white et al 
while concentrations of inorganic n are proportionately much
lower than required for growth no− po

 −
 ratios of the upper

ocean our results suggest that energetic limitations likely do
not restrict eukaryotic phytoplankton consumption of available
n substrates in this habitat 

we observed moderate to large changes in the phytoplankton
community response to n additions shifting from a
picophytoplankton dominated community – 
picophytoplankton contribution to c primary production and
 – contribution of picophytoplankton to chl a by the end
of experiments to one with a greater contribution by the larger
 µm phytoplankton – contribution to c primary
production and – contribution to chl a by the end of
experiments sequencing of s rdna provided insight into
the types of eukaryotic phytoplankton in these size classes 
the larger µm phytoplankton community was comprised

mainly of dinoflagellates at the onset of the experiment however 
following the addition of n substrates diatom composition
rapidly within – days expanded contributing – of
the µm sequences intriguingly we observed that relative
abundances of various taxa of pennate diatoms were elevated
in the – µm filter fraction following the addition of nh 
and no− during experiments conducted in the summer such
cells might be expected to be larger than µm hence it’s unclear
whether such results reflect time varying differences in the
sizes of these cells poor trapping efficiency of these cells by the
 µm filters or potential breakage of cells during filtration with
subsequent retention of fragmented cells by the µm filter 

the diatom response was most significant during the
experiments conducted in the summer particularly in the
no− treatment where diatoms comprised ∼ of the
 µm sequences at the end of the experiments such
observations are consistent with those of mahaffey et al 
who observed greater responses ∼ fold in phytoplankton
biomass following nutrient enrichment with deep sea water
during the summer months than in other times of the year 
consistent with microscopic observations at station aloha
 venrick scharek et al diatoms were present
in low concentrations ∼ of total sequences at the onset
of our experiments the large response by diatoms following
the addition of n likely partly reflects their physiological
capacity to outcompete other phytoplankton for available n
when concentrations of no− and nh

 
 are elevated eppley

et al and highlights potential n limitation of diatoms
during summer periods in addition these results presumably
reflect decoupling between diatom growth and removal processes

rii et al eukaryotic phytoplankton response to nitrogen

such as predation parasitism or viral lysis during the summer 
permitting accumulation of pennate diatoms during this period 
thus the diatom response to nitrogenous substrates observed
during the experiments conducted in the summer suggests
there are season specific conditions at station aloha such as
elevated incident light flux and warm upper ocean temperatures 
that may favor diatom growth and allow them to outgrow or
escape removal in order to accumulate biomass 

while diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton to respond
to n additions in the µm fraction in all of the experiments 
differential response between seasons was observed among the
picophytoplankton diatoms were still the major responders
to n additions in the picophytoplankton fraction during the
summer however the pelagophyte pelagomonas responded to
additions of n substrates in the winter and spring while
such results may reflect that smaller pennate diatoms are
limited by some other nutrient e g iron vitamins during
the spring and winter months our results highlight that other
groups of picophytoplankton in particular the pelagophytes 
respond rapidly to n availability during these periods although
pelagophytes comprised – of the picophytoplankton
sequences at the onset of the summer experiments they
comprised a much larger fraction – of the sequences at
the onset of the winter and spring experiments as pelagophytes
are typically found in greatest abundances in the low lit regions
of the euphotic zone i e letelier et al bidigare and
ondrusek timmermans et al the higher relative
abundances of these organisms during the winter and spring
months in the surface waters at station aloha was somewhat
surprising we suspect that pelagomonasmay respond to periods
when the mixed layer extends into the lower region of the
euphotic zone – m entraining organisms and nutrients
typically found in the dimly lit regions of the euphotic zone into
the well lit upper ocean as such the survival of pelagophytes
in the upper euphotic zone during this period of deeper mixing
may reflect their flexible photophysiology dimier et al 
bidigare et al compared to other phytoplankton such
as some diatoms whose growth rates often decrease under
fluctuating light conditions van de poll et al their
success may also be due to their ability to acquire n through the
increased supply of no− to the euphotic zone during periods
of deeper mixing as consistent with studies indicating elevated
expression of no− transporter genes by pelagomonas dupont
et al moreover there may be differences in selective
removal processes in the upper vs lower euphotic zone that
specifically impact pelagomonas or other competing organisms 
resulting in the accumulation of pelagomonas during this
particular time of year hence we suspect that the rapid response
by pelagophytes specifically pelagomonas during spring and
winter resulted from the relatively elevated abundances of these
organisms at the onset of the experiments which may or may not
reflect selective removal processes as well as their ability to grow
rapidly following the input of bioavailable n 

examination of alpha diversity during our experiments
revealed a differential response in the size structure of eukaryotic
phytoplankton diversity with the addition of n substrates 
indicating varying degrees of resource competition amongst

the different size classes while the addition of n substrates
induced “bloom” like conditions in picophytoplankton thereby
significantly decreasing alpha diversity addition of nitrogenous
substrates induced growth in different taxa in the larger µm 
phytoplankton throughout the year e g alpha diversity of the n
treatments remained similar to the controls except in summer
when diatoms dominated this suggests that picophytoplankton
diversity is more strongly influenced by competition for nutrients
compared to the larger phytoplankton 

the proliferation of different taxa in our experiments
during different times of the year presumably also reflects
temporal variability in the strength of various top down controls
 predation viruses parasites our experiments excluded large
grazers µm presumably eliminating the influences of
larger mesozooplankton as potential controls on phytoplankton
diversity and community structure however microzooplankton
and heterotrophic and mixotrophic protists can be significant
grazers of phytoplankton biomass of chl a per day 
in the open ocean calbet and landry though larger
diatoms may be too big to be consumed efficiently by nano 
and micro predators frost cullen smaller pennate
diatoms typically – µm in length can be readily consumed
by microzooplankton latasa et al however latasa
et al observed that growth and grazing of diatoms and
pelagophytes were uncoupled in the upper ocean allowing net
phytoplankton growth in the central equatorial pacific thus the
rapid turnover of fast growing species through active removal
processes may maintain greater diversity such as among the
larger phytoplankton during the spring despite the availability
of nutrients longhurst timonin 

the apparent seasonally dependent responses by the
phytoplankton assemblage to n availability may provide insight
into previously observed patterns in carbon export in the
npsg in particular karl et al describe diatom driven
summertime export of several bioelements to the deep sea
 m at station aloha based on years of sediment 
trap derived measurements of particulate matter flux these
authors highlight the role of diatom aggregation and sinking in
regulating a large fraction of the annual export in this ecosystem 
moreover this seasonal event appears fueled by n supply via
n fixation karl et al other studies conducted in the
npsg further highlight diatom responses to nutrient availability 
for example analyses of particulate matter export from the
upper ocean into the mesopelagic waters have revealed that
nutrient supply via mesoscale eddies stimulates diatom growth
and subsequent preferential settling of silica enriched biomass
 benitez nelson et al in our experiments larger diatoms
 µm consistently responded to the addition of n substrates 
suggesting these organisms are poised for rapid growth following
n input via n fixation or vertical supply via mixing or mesoscale
isopycnal uplift 

interestingly the initial eukaryotic phytoplankton
communities in the larger size class but also during the
summer in the picophytoplankton size class were dominated by
members of the dinophyceae autotrophic dinoflagellates such
as gymnodinium are reported to lack peridinin while containing
fucoxanthin related carotenoids millie et al such

rii et al eukaryotic phytoplankton response to nitrogen

findings may explain why we observed high relative abundances
of dinoflagellate otus in our study while observations at station
aloha indicate low concentrations of peridinin letelier
et al bidigare and ondrusek alternatively the
dominance of dinoflagellates in s rdna sequences may be
due to high rrna gene copy numbers previously described
among the dinoflagellates zhu et al not et al 
medinger et al moreover the primers targeting the
region v of the s rrna gene amplified in the current
study may preferentially amplify dinoflagellates stoeck et al 
 biasing the sequence results toward these organisms 
a recent pcr independent metatranscriptome approach
found that dinoflagellates dominated – the mapped
eukaryote transcripts at station aloha alexander et al 
suggesting that dinoflagellates are indeed important contributors
to phytoplankton biomass in this ecosystem in the current study 
despite their initial dominance dinoflagellates did not respond
significantly to additions of no− nh

 
 or urea concentrations

of peridinin increased gradually in the experiments where hplc
pigments were measured in july and april but to
a lesser extent than other measured pigments consistent with
these results additions of nutrient enriched deep sea water
to upper ocean plankton assemblages resulted in a minimal
transcriptional response by dinoflagellates alexander et al 
 such results and those observed in the current study 
may suggest that the dominant dinoflagellates at station aloha
are heterotrophic or mixotrophic potentially decreasing
their dependence on inorganic n substrates consistent with
this hypothesis several of the taxa that predominated at the
beginning of our experiments are closely related to mixotrophic
organisms including dinoflagellates haptophytes chrysophytes 
and dictyochophytes rothhaupt frias lopez et al 
liu et al however following n additions many of
these taxa decreased in relative abundance with organisms not
previously known to demonstrate mixotrophic growth namely
diatoms and pelagophytes becoming increasing dominant such
results provide support to the hypothesis that limiting nutrients
are crucial to shaping plankton physiology including promoting
mixotrophic modes of nutrient acquisition zubkov and tarran 
 hartmann et al 

in summary after addition of inorganic n substrates we
observed a general shift in the size structure of the phytoplankton
community from a picophytoplankton dominated one to a
community dominated by larger µm phytoplankton in

our experiments responses in c primary production and
photosynthetic pigment biomass appeared independent of the
type of n substrate added however resulting changes in the

picophytoplankton community composition appeared seasonally
dependent with diatoms dominating the response during the
summer while pelagophytes responded most significantly in
the winter and spring diatoms in the µm size fraction
appear to be poised for rapid net growth throughout the year 
while smaller pennate diatoms appeared best able to capitalize
on added n during the summer months the variability in
the responses by phytoplankton may stem from differences in
initial picophytoplankton populations or time varying top down
controls which likely vary with seasonal changes in mixed layer
depth and light our findings provide insight into how abrupt
changes in the availability of fixed n influence successional
patterns in eukaryotic phytoplankton assemblages and highlight
those organisms poised for rapid net growth when fixed n is
available
