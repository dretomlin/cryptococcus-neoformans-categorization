factors influencing it within the anchialine ecosystem 

defined as near shore land locked water bodies with

subsurface connections to the ocean and groundwater

aquifer the hawaiian archipelago is home to

numerous anchialine habitats with some on the

islands of maui and hawaii harboring unique lami 

nated orange cyanobacterial–bacterial crusts that

independently assembled in relatively young basalt

fields here benthic and water column bacterial and

micro eukaryotic communities from nine anchialine

habitats on oahu maui and hawaii were surveyed

using high throughput amplicon sequencing of the v 

 bacteria specific and v eukarya biased hyper 

variable regions of the s and s rdna genes 

respectively while benthic communities from habi 

tats with cyanobacterial–bacterial crusts were more

similar to each other than to ones lacking it on the

same island each habitat had distinct benthic and

water column microbial communities analyses of the

survey data in the context of environmental factors

identified salinity site aquifer and watershed as

having the highest explanatory power for the observed

variation in microbial diversity and community struc 

ture with lesser drivers being annual rainfall longi

results epitomize the abiotic and biotic uniqueness

characteristic of individual habitats comprising the

introduction

examining microbial communities from unusual

habitats and ecosystems has proved invaluable in

growing our biological understanding of the world as

well as in developing new technologies for example 

research on laminated microbial mats found in

hotsprings of yellowstone national park montana 

usa led to the discovery of taq polymerase chien

et al ishino ishino which revolu 

tionized genetic lab techniques while also providing

insight into how life evolved on earth walter et al 

 konhauser et al and may evolve on other

planets walker et al furthermore microbial

mat communities with bioremediation potential have

been identified from ‘‘extreme’’ environments created

by aquaculture effluent paniagua michel garcia 

 bender phillips and mine drainages

 bender et al phillips et al given that

the examination of microbial communities from

unusual environments can lead to potential advances

in biotechnology and increased scientific knowledge

in fields like microbial ecology and evolution it is

surprising that some habitats and ecosystems remain

understudied to the point that even basic information

regarding the taxonomic diversity contained within

them remains largely lacking microbial communities

from the anchialine ecosystem are one such example

of this situation 

the anchialine ecosystem is characterized as near 

shore bodies of water with both fluctuating volumes

and salinities but lacking surface connections to the

ocean holthuis maciolek stock et al 

 sket habitats fitting this definition are

found worldwide across the tropics holthuis 

maciolek thomas et al sket 

humphreys bishop et al garman et al 

 menning et al and occur within a variety

of basin substrates including karst caves blue holes 

cenotes natural wells and springs fossilized coral

reefs and basalt i e lava fields of varying ages

 holthuis maciolek sket due to

their simultaneous connections to the ocean and

groundwater aquifer anchialine habitats can exhibit

complex clines in nutrient concentration and temper 

ature in addition to widely varying salinities over the

tidal cycle stock et al humphreys 

bishop et al although high levels of species

richness and endemism have been well documented

among macroorganisms from the anchialine ecosys 

tem holthuis maciolek brock 

yager brock bailey brock iliffe 

 kano kase mejı́a ortı́z et al 

much less is known regarding the microbial commu 

nities that occur within it sarbu et al pohlman

et al seymour et al gonzalez et al 

 humphreys et al thus hampering efforts

towards understanding the potential roles microbes

play in the functioning of this ecosystem 

in the few studies done to date microbial commu 

nities of the anchialine ecosystem were found to play

major roles in nutrient cycling and primary production

 sarbu et al pohlman et al including

being the autotrophic basis of the food web dalton

et al furthermore microbial community

compositions and distributions in anchialine habitats

can be strongly affected by environmental factors like

water chemistry resulting in variable community

structures along clines for instance vertically struc 

tured microbial communities correlating with depth

and clines of dissolved oxygen hydrogen sulfide and

dissolved inorganic nitrogen were reported from the

bundera sinkhole seymour et al humphreys

et al and between adjacent km 
bahamian blue holes with differing hydrogen sulfide

clines gonzalez et al in the hawaiian

archipelago home to the world’s highest concentra 

tion of anchialine habitats a number of pools or ponds

harbor distinctive laminated orange cyanobacterial–

bacterial crusts endemic to the anchialine ecosystem

of the islands maciolek brock wong 

brock et al bailey brock brock 

while previous surveys of these crusts via light and

scanning electron microscopy revealed numerous

cyanobacteria diatoms and ciliates they were limited

to the identification of morphologically distinct taxa

and only briefly mentioned the presence of

‘‘various cocci and bacilli’’ prokaryotic cells with no

assessment of their taxonomic affinities and the

environmental factors potentially influencing their

distribution wong bailey brock brock 

 

in the above context the objectives of this study

were to survey the diversity composition and

structure among benthic and water column microbial

 i e bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities

from anchialine habitats on the three hawaiian islands

where they naturally occur and identify potential

environmental factors driving microbial diversity and

community structure across these hawaiian anchialine

habitats notably habitats were chosen to span a

breadth of chemical geological and physical factors 

including likely variation in water chemistry such as

nutrient concentrations and salinity differing basin

substrates and examples of open pools or ponds versus

caves given the breadth of factors occurring either

singularly or in combination we hypothesized that

each habitat across this sampling of the hawaiian

anchialine ecosystem possessed a unique microbial

community that reflects its particular geographic

location and environmental characteristics we further

hypothesized that if similarities in microbial commu 

nity structure were identified between habitats these

would correlate with similarities in their environmen 

tal factors this study to the best of our knowledge is

the first to examine both bacterial and micro eukary 

otic communities across a range of habitats belonging

to the anchialine ecosystem

 fig b d are primarily restricted to the cape kinau

and kona regions of the islands of maui and hawaii 

respectively fig a and although these crust com 

munities across the two islands appear visually

identical they have assembled independently of

each other since maui and hawaii have never shared a

physical connection and relatively quickly and

repetitively on each island due to the comparatively

young i e years old lava fields in which they
occur being rendered sterile by high temperatures

samples were collected over days to minimize

operational taxonomic unit otu clustering

sequence reads were processed in pandaseq v 

 masella et al to align the paired ends trim off

primer sequences and filter out those with uncalled

bases the fastq quality filter part of the fastx 

toolkit v gordon hannon was then

used to filter reads using a conservative quality score

cut off of over at least of the sequenced

nucleotides potentially chimeric sequences were fil 

tered using usearch edgar as distributed

in the qiime v pipeline caporaso et al b 

within qiime sequences were clustered into opera 

tional taxonomic units otus at a conservative 

sequence similarity and abundance through the

pick open reference otus py workflow

using uclust edgar and the clustered

greengenes desantis et al and the 

clustered silva quast et al databases as

initial cluster references for the v and v hypervari 

able regions respectively notably we adopted the

 otu abundance filter as recommended by

bokulich et al for improvement of clustering

results furthermore a sequence similarity param 

eter was selected to lump rather than split otus the

use of a sequence similarity resulted in and 

additional v and v otus respectively data not

shown suggesting sequence similarity stringency did

not significantly impact otu richness for each otu

cluster the most abundant sequence was selected to act

as the reference for that cluster taxonomic identities

were then assigned to cluster references using mega 

blast v altschul et al to the appro 

priate curated database mentioned above at a sequence

identity of c and e value of all otus

were aligned against the appropriate curated database

with pynast v caporaso et al a under

default parameters i e minimum length of 

median input length minimum identity and any

otus failing to align were filtered from the final

tables see below 

analyses of community composition

and environmental factors

alpha diversity measured as the number of observed

otus as well as chao chao shannon

 shannon and inverse simpson simpson 

 diversity indices were calculated on the final

otu abundance tables and plotted using phyloseq

v in r r development core team 

mcmurdie holmes specifically chao 

estimates the total number of taxa by assuming a

sample with many rare otus taxa likely contains

additional ones that escaped initial detection chao 

 on the other hand shannon diversity quantifies

the uncertainty in predicting what otus taxa the next

sampled sequence would belong to such that higher

shannon values reflect greater diversity shannon 

 lastly simpson’s index quantifies the proba 

bility that two random sequences belong to the same

otus taxa with a lower index reflecting greater

diversity due to the inverted relationship between

simpson’s index and diversity we used its inverse

since it reports the richness of a perfectly even

community that would have the same diversity as the

observed sample rarefaction curves were generated

for these diversity indices in r using ten replicates of

 and 

randomly selected sequences per sample to gauge

the effectiveness of our sampling depth at capturing

the diversity and composition of the hawaiian

anchialine bacterial and micro eukaryotic communi 

ties under examination 

microbial community compositions elucidated

from the v and v rdna gene hypervariable regions

were visualized as stacked bar plots of the proportion

of each taxonomic group present at a sample site using

the summarize taxa through plots py

script from the qiime v pipeline caporaso

et al b additionally core otus i e ones

shared by all samples from a specified group for

benthic and water column communities of both orange

cyanobacterial–bacterial crust and cave sites were

identified using the script compute core mi 

crobiome py caporaso et al b 

to compare community composition and examine

how categorical and continuous environmental factors

contributed to microbial diversity and structure

between sites a non metric multidimensional scaling

 nmds ordination with confidence ellipses was

created using both a jaccard dissimilarity coefficient

matrix and a bray–curtis dissimilarity matrix calcu 

lated from otu and environmental matrices trans 

formed to even sampling depth in the r package

phyloseq v specifically the jaccard dissimi 

larity coefficient returns the proportion of unshared

taxa between samples and only considers their

presence or absence jaccard while the bray–

curtis dissimilarity metric is based on the abundance

of otus shared between communities bray curtis 

 the individual explanatory power of the

continuous environmental factors on sample ordina 

tions was investigated with the envfit function 

permutations in the r package vegan v oksa 

nen et al fitted vectors generated from

continuous environmental factors with significant

explanatory power of the sample ordinations

 a were then scaled by their explanatory
power r and overlaid onto the nmds ordinations 

using the bioenv function in the r package vegan

v we additionally identified the combination of

categorical and continuous environmental factors that

best predicted the observed otu abundances calcu 

lated as the subset whose euclidean distance resem 

blance matrix had a maximum spearman correlation

with the final otu tables in other words this

approach elucidates the combination of environmental

factors whose distance matrices best approximate the

v and v otu abundance based distance matrices

 clarke ainsworth finally we utilized an

analysis of similarity anosim as proposed by

clarke with the bray–curtis dissimilarity

matrix to determine whether there was a significant

difference in otu composition between samples

ble overlap with specific cyanobacteria diatoms 

dinoflagellates and green algae online resource 

including members of the historic cyanobacterial

subsections i iv as well as of diatom of 

dinoflagellate and of green algae genera wong 

 potential reasons for our inability to recover all

of the previously identified taxa include the fact that

the exact same sites were not sampled differing

recovery biases between microscopy and sequencing 

based approaches and that regional environmental

conditions on each island may have shifted in the

 years since these previous surveys with subse 

quent changes in community composition of these

orange cyanobacterial–bacterial crusts additionally 

revisions in species names and taxonomic ranks since

 and the years in which these other surveys

were published wong bailey brock brock 

 may also contribute to our failing to recover the

exact same taxa that were previously identified 

of the few studies examining the microbial diver 

sity of hawaii’s soils or freshwaters phyla identified

as occurring in young volcanic soils and forests on

the island of hawaii included acidobacteria acti 

nobacteria alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria 

chloroflexi clostridia cyanobacteria gammapro 

teobacteria deltaproteobacteria epsilonproteobacte 

ria fibrobacteres firmicutes and planctomycetes

 nüsslein tiedje dunfield king 

 gomez alvarez et al which were also

recovered in our survey of habitats from the hawaiian

anchialine ecosystem furthermore most phyla iden 

tified in a survey of five hawaiian lakes donachie

et al were also found in our study with the

exception of euryarchaeota and the candidate divi 

sions while the distinctive orange cyanobacterial–

bacterial crust communities found in the cape kinau

and kona regions of maui and hawaii respectively 

are endemic to the hawaiian anchialine ecosystem 

some of the same constituent phyla are also found in

other anchialine habitats for example an anchialine

pool on pearl and hermes atoll in the northwest

hawaiian islands possessed members of the

cyanobacteria firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria

 donachie et al with a subsequently cultured

gammaproteobacterium appearing to belong to a

novel genus zepeda et al along with this a

survey of the microbial communities of two anchialine

caves on mljet island in the adriatic sea identified

deltaproteobacteria epsilonproteobacteria and

gammaproteobacteria as the major resident bacterial

lineages with abundances of the latter and former

being concentrated at the surface and below m 

respectively and epsilonproteobacteria distributed

ubiquitously krstulović et al while epsilon 

proteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria might be con 

sidered relatively minor contributors to the hawaiian

anchialine microbial communities examined here 

gammaproteobacteria accounted for of the

total v sequences generated in our survey specifi 

cally most of the gammaproteobacteria sequences

while the two cave sites on different islands shared

relatively high numbers of benthic bacterial otus 

identification of core bacterial and micro eukaryotic

otus i e ones shared by all samples from a specific

group among the orange cyanobacterial–bacterial

crust communities of maui and hawaii revealed

limited overlap between islands with both the benthos

and water columns on the same island having higher

numbers of shared core otus and more similar

communities than with the other island table 

interestingly no specific cyanobacterial otus were

identified as core constituents among the orange

cyanobacterial–bacterial crust communities of both

maui and hawaii despite higher taxonomic groups of

cyanobacteria being common between sites along

with this larger numbers of bacterial and micro 

eukaryotic otus were found as shared core commu 

nity members on hawaii than maui despite orange

cyanobacterial–bacterial crust sites on hawaii having

greater geographic separation and the potential for

isolation by distance than those on maui one

possibility for the greater core community diversity

on hawaii may be due in part to the lower salinity of

these habitats compared to orange cyanobacterial–

bacterial crust habitats on maui table which

allows for the persistence of a wider range of taxa 

such a situation where diversity and structure in

aquatic microbial communities negatively correlated

with increasing salinities also see below has been

reported from numerous high altitude tibetan lakes

results as well as those of these previous studies 

exemplify the fact that similarity in environmental

factors does not always result from close proximity

and further emphasize the abiotic complexity of

anchialine habitats and this ecosystem in general

 stock et al sket humphreys 

bishop et al marrack et al 

of the environmental factors examined here salin 

ity had some of the highest explanatory power for both

the observed alpha diversity estimates i e fig and

otu composition based community variation i e 

fig online resource suggesting it may be the

dominant water chemistry parameter as similarly

determined for high altitude tibetan lakes wu et al 

 yang et al concerning the eukarya 

biased v longitude was also identified as influential

and corresponds to both island as well as the presence

of the unique orange cyanobacterial–bacterial crust

since such sites occur across short longitudinal

gradients on maui and hawaii but a relatively longer

latitudinal gradient on hawaii fig examination of

other individual environmental factors also identified

the categorical factors of site aquifer and watershed

as well as the continuous factors of ammonium and

doc as also having high explanatory power given

this we propose that the presence of unique benthic

and water column communities at each site results in

the significance of site aquifer and watershed with

salinity ammonium and doc being major drivers of

bacterial and micro eukaryotic community diversity

and structure in the hawaiian anchialine ecosystem at

the level of individual habitats for example and as

mentioned earlier salinity of the anchialine habitats

examined here correlated with island such that sites

on hawaii had the lowest and those on maui had the

highest table which likely drives differences in

overall community diversity these findings corre 

spond with those of wong wong who

identified salinity as important in dictating the dom 

inant algal or cyanobacterial taxa in anchialine

habitats at cape kinau maui in riverine bacterio 

plankton communities increased salinity results in

alterations to both community composition and

metabolism by favoring a shift in the community

towards saline tolerant members leading to less

efficiency in the consumption of doc langenheder

et al coincidently the anchialine habitats

examined here with greater salinity also had higher

levels of doc table suggesting an analogous

situation where the bacterial and micro eukaryotic

communities at higher salinity sites are less efficient at

consuming doc in support of this benthic epilithon

communities from orange cyanobacterial–bacterial

crust containing anchialine habitats on hawaii

responded differentially with subsequent shifts in

community composition to nitrogen n and phos 

phorus p enrichment depending on salinity sakihara

et al given that lower salinity sites exhibited

an increase in epilithon chlorophyll a while suppres 

sion of epilithon chlorophyll a occurred at higher

salinity sites in response to n and p enrichment

 sakihara et al the authors inferred that

salinity and to a lesser extent other environmental

factors ultimately impact nutrient utilization by and

subsequent function of these hawaiian anchialine

microbial communities via influencing their member

composition 

considerations of microbial diversity

in conservation efforts for hawaiian anchialine

habitats

given that the abiotic and biotic uniqueness of individ 

ual hawaiian anchialine habitats is only now being

appreciated seidel et al it is unfortunate that

they have been vulnerable both historically and cur 

rently to destruction and degradation primarily due to

coastal development and invasive species introductions

 bailey brock brock brock bailey brock 

 marrack et al unfortunately these threats

to habitats and biota of the hawaiian anchialine

ecosystem are expected to continue or intensify via

processes like ongoing and future urbanization or global

climate change allowing dispersal of invasive species

into uninvaded habitats marrack while a

number of shrimp species found in hawaii’s anchialine

ecosystem are listed as state of hawaii and federal

attention towards preserving global microbial diversity

the islands 

while the technological advancement of high 

throughput amplicon sequencing allowed us to eluci 

date the diverse bacterial and micro eukaryotic com 

munities present in a range of habitats belonging to the

hawaiian anchialine ecosystem much remains to be

investigated for example finer taxonomic assignment

is difficult given the relatively short length of illumina

sequence reads and our conservative clustering param 

eters removed both otus failing to align with the

reference databases and rare otus which potentially

represent novel taxa or the controversial ‘rare bio

dynamics and subsequent changes in microbial com 

munity diversity and or composition spanning from

habitat creation to senescence are unknown in any

case the data and analyses presented here illustrate

howgeographic location and associated environmental

factors such as salinity significantly drive bacterial and

conclusion

this study represents both the first detailed genetic

survey of bacterial and micro eukaryotic diversity as

well as the first attempt to identify potential environ 

mental factors driving spatial variation in microbial

community composition and structure across

hawaii’s anchialine ecosystem here high through 

put amplicon sequencing identified significant differ 

ences in bacterial and micro eukaryotic diversity 

composition and structure across anchialine habitats

on the hawaiian islands of oahu maui and hawaii 

each habitat proved to have a unique microbial

community and multiple categorial and continuous

environmental factors including salinity site water 

shed and doc appear to be significant drivers for

these patterns while the distinctive and endemic

orange cyanobacterial–bacterial crust communities

from maui and hawaii were more similar to each

other in community composition than with non crust

communities they were distinguishable not only by

island but by site as well
