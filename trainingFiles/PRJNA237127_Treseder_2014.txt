abstract
although fungal communities are known to vary along latitudinal gradients mechanisms underly 
ing this pattern are not well understood we used high throughput sequencing to examine the
large scale distributions of soil fungi and their relation to evolutionary history we tested the trop 
ical conservatism hypothesis which predicts that ancestral fungal groups should be more
restricted to tropical latitudes and conditions than would more recently derived groups we found
support for this hypothesis in that older phyla preferred significantly lower latitudes and warmer 
wetter conditions than did younger phyla moreover preferences for higher latitudes and lower pre 
cipitation levels were significantly phylogenetically conserved among the six younger phyla possibly
because the older phyla possess a zoospore stage that is vulnerable to drought whereas the younger
phyla retain protective cell walls throughout their life cycle our study provides novel evidence that
the tropical conservatism hypothesis applies to microbes as well as plants and animals

introduction

numerous studies have reported shifts in fungal community
composition by latitude temperature and precipitation
 arnold lutzoni tedersoo et al kivlin
et al sun et al €opik et al such spatial
shifts are expected to contain phylogenetic patterns if we
assume that the evolution of key morphological or physiologi 
cal traits of fungal taxa determines their response to tempera 
ture and precipitation these traits include possession of cell
walls or the presence of regular septa in turn these traits
could constrain the geographic distribution of fungal taxa 
nevertheless the relationships between the evolutionary his 
tory of soil fungi and their biogeographical patterns remain
largely unknown especially at very large scales 
for many terrestrial plants and animals younger taxa tend

to reside at higher latitudes hillebrand weir schluter
 buckley et al hawkins et al romdal et al 
 the tropical conservatism hypothesis tch repre 
sents one potential explanation for this pattern e g wiens 
donoghue whereby older groups that evolved under
warmer wetter conditions are constrained by phylogenetic
niche conservatism making it difficult for them to evolve the
necessary physiological traits that allow them to proliferate
under cooler drier climates thus older groups and their
traits are more likely to be restricted to lower latitudes 
whereas younger groups can reside at higher latitudes it is
unknown however whether these patterns apply to fungi 

here we test predictions of tch as they may apply to a
group of organisms much older than those normally consid 
ered the earth’s paleoclimate was relatively warm and wet
during the earliest evolution of ancestral fungi whereas severe
ice ages evans et al kopp et al smith and
drought algeo scheckler occurred later in their evo 
lutionary history we hypothesized that younger fungal phyla
should be more likely to reside in soils of higher latitudes 
with older lineages having evolved traits that provide maximal
fitness under warm and wet conditions we also explored the
distributions of potential traits that could account for the spa 
tial structure of lineage ages 
we are focusing on the biogeography of soil fungi at the

phylum level because we are examining evolutionary histories
over very long time periods that correspond to divergence at
this broad taxonomic level the divergence of fungal phyla
coincided with key evolutionary events some of which could
have conferred greater tolerance to stressful environmental
conditions for example the ancestral phyla cryptomycota 
chytridiomycota and blastocladiomycota each reproduce via
zoospores which do not have cell walls the zoospore form was
lost from younger phyla liu et al stajich et al 
james et al this event may have coincided with the
onset of extreme cold periods during the neoproterozoic
 evans et al smith it is well documented that fun 
gal cell walls protect the interior from damage caused by freez 
ing desiccation and osmotic stresses reviewed in latg�e 
some zoosporic fungi can produce resting or resistant spores

that allow them to become dormant during stressful condi 
tions but they nevertheless form zoospores upon germination
 olson thus their active phases may be relatively lim 
ited under stressful conditions 
differentiated tissues with regular septa are thought to have

evolved in the two youngest phyla ascomycota and basidi 
omycota also known as the dikarya during the devonian
 stajich et al kumar et al healy et al in
this period much of the earth’s land mass was located in the
naturally arid zone near the tropic of capricorn algeo 
scheckler so land based fungi should have been
exposed to dry conditions regular septa of the dikarya
include central pores that can be plugged by specialized
organelles and together they form a regulatory structure that
improves water conservation under dry conditions and
reduces leakage that might occur from freeze thaw ruptures
 maruyama et al beck et al in comparison reg 
ular septa like these are rare within older phyla and are
known to occur in only a few groups within the kickxellomy 
cotina tretter et al altogether the elimination of the
zoospore stage and the evolution of regular septa might each
contribute to the latitudinal distributions of fungal phyla 
to test our hypothesis we mapped the distributions of

fungal taxa in soils collected from local communities across
the western hemisphere for each taxon we calculated the
average latitudinal distance from the equator i e higher ver 
sus lower latitudes mean annual temperature and mean
annual precipitation for sites in which the taxon was
detected these were considered the environmental conditions
‘preferred’ by each taxon akin to niche space finally 
we related these preferred environments to phylum age and
phylum level traits 

materials and methods

study sites

we assayed soils from sites in north and south america 
this number of sites was smaller than some other large scale
analyses e g lauber et al nevertheless the sites rep 
resented a wide range in latitude °s to °n mean
annual temperature � to °c and mean annual pre 
cipitation to mm year� table s which allowed
us to test relationships with each parameter for these sites 
mean annual temperature and precipitation were relatively
high near the equator and then declined substantially at
higher latitudes fig s moreover mean annual tempera 
ture and precipitation were positively associated across sites
 fig s sites with lower precipitation rates also experienced
greater drought i e soil moisture deficit fig s in addi 
tion of the sites were dominated by at least one ectomy 
corrhizal ecm host plant table s these sites tended to
differ from the others in terms of distance from the equator

the top cm of mineral soil was composited from to 
locations within a given site near the peak plant growing

season these soil samples were identical to a subset of those
reported in fierer jackson 

dna sequencing and analysis

dna was extracted from to g dry weight of each soil
sample as described in lauber et al we used universal
fungal primers of borneman hartin modified for
barcoded pyrosequencing to amplify a bp region of the
 s rrna gene as in mcguire et al this region
extends from nucleotide to of the s sequence of
saccharomyces cerevisiae and includes the v partial and v 
variable regions borneman hartin this primer set
has previously been used to successfully amplify cryptomy 
cota blastocladiomycota chytridiomycota zygomycota 
mucoromycotina glomeromycota ascomycota and basidi 
omycota borneman hartin nagahama et al 
cryptomycota are classified as fungi jones et al a b 
capella gutierrez et al james et al we obtained
 fungal sequences representing to sequences
per sample the quantitative insights into microbial ecology
 qiime pipeline was then used to process sequences capor 
aso et al sequences were quality checked aligned and
grouped into phylotypes hereafter ‘taxa’ at a sequence
similarity cut off this cut off corresponds to approximately
the family level for this dna region anderson et al 
one representative sequence from each taxon was chosen 
each representative sequence was identified to phylum by
blast comparison against all non environmental fungal
sequences in genbank https www ncbi nlm nih gov gen 
bank we double checked our identifications by manually
performing blast comparisons with curated sequences pro 
duced by the assembling the fungal tree of life aftol 
project james et al we randomly selected 
sequences per sample to control for differences in sequence
number among samples 
altogether fungal taxa were identified to phylum and

collectively they represented nine phyla table s a repre 
sentative sequence of each taxon has been submitted to gen 
bank under the bioproject accession prjna one
hundred seventeen of these taxa matched ≥ identity a
sequence from an aftol or other vouchered specimen so
they could be identified at a higher taxonomic resolution
 table s for each taxon we determined the average i e 
‘preferred’ distance from the equator mean annual tempera 
ture and mean annual precipitation of the sites in which it
was observed distance from the equator was computed as
degrees latitude north or south so that greater distance indi 
cates higher latitudes regardless of hemisphere note that we
did not weight these preferences by relative abundance of the
taxon in each site to be conservative preferences were calcu 
lated solely based on presence absence data moreover none
of the data was normally distributed so we performed all sta 
tistical analyses on ranked data or with nonparametric tests 
systat version chicago il usa was used for
all non phylogenetic tests and differences were considered sig 
nificant when p 
first we tested whether phyla differed from one another in

environmental preferences with a series of kruskal–wallis

tests analogous to a nonparametric one way analysis of vari 
ance sokal rohlf we used phylum identity as the
independent variable and each environmental preference in
turn as a dependent variable units of observation were indi 
vidual taxa in each case a kolmogorov–smirnov test for
pairwise differences was applied post hoc sokal rohlf
 
second we quantified relationships between phylum age

and environmental preferences we conducted a mixed hierar 
chical regression between phylum age independent variable 
and preferred distance from equator dependent variable a
mixed hierarchical regression is essentially a linear regression
that allowed us to nest taxa within phyla raudenbush 
this approach takes into account the fact that taxa were
related within phyla in other words phyla—but not taxa
within phyla—were considered to be independent moreover 
we used a mixed hierarchical regression because our data were
not distributed equally among phyla and this test is not sensi 
tive to unequal distributions raudenbush for phylum
age we used rankings of basal ages from stajich et al 
which are based on calibrations from taylor berbee 
and the aftol phylogenetic tree james et al taxa
represented data points that were nested within phylum 
phylum was the unit of analysis a significant negative rela 
tionship between preferred distance from equator and phylum
age would be consistent with our hypothesis similar mixed
hierarchical regressions were then performed with preferred
mean annual temperature or preferred mean annual precipita 
tion as the dependent variables significant relationships
between phylum age and these environmental conditions
would aid the interpretation of any latitudinal patterns 
third we performed phylogenetic independent contrasts

between phylum age and environmental preferences as an
additional test of our hypothesis for these analyses we used
the phylogeny of james et al which includes the s
rdna region as well as five other genes to better resolve early
evolutionary events we pruned the phylogeny so that it
included one representative of each of the nine phyla from
our study we applied the phylocom aot algorithm
 webb et al to conduct a set of phylogenetic indepen 
dent contrasts between the basal age of each phylum from
stajich et al and each environmental preference pro 
portional branch lengths were used units of observation were
phyla thus for each phylum we used the mean preferred
distance from equator temperature or precipitation for all
taxa within that phylum 
fourth we examined morphological or physiological traits

that might have influenced environmental preferences we did
so by performing a series of comparisons among dichotomous
traits that differed at the phylum level the traits were presence
vs absence of a zoospore stage and presence vs absence of
regular septa in hyphae for each trait we used the phylocom
 aot algorithm webb et al to check for significant
phylogenetic conservation of each environmental preference
within the relevant clade specifically we tested whether the
clade representing phyla without a zoospore stage entomoph 
thoromycota mucoromycotina zygomycota glomeromy 
cota ascomycota and basidiomycota displayed phylogenetic
conservation of greater preferred distance from the equator 

lower temperature and less precipitation we next tested
whether environmental preferences were conserved within the
clade representing phyla with regular septa ascomycota and
basidiomycota for both tests of phylogenetic conservation 
phylum was the unit of analysis for each phylum we used the
mean preferred distance from equator temperature or precipi 
tation for all taxa within that phylum

discussion

overall the age of fungal phyla was related to their biogeo 
graphic distributions in soils of north and south america as
we had hypothesized in general older fungal phyla tended
to reside in soils of lower latitudes than did younger phyla
 figs and these preferences may have been tied to the
ability of taxa to tolerate cooler and drier conditions as
younger phyla were also found in ecosystems with lower
temperatures and precipitation rates figs and 
together these patterns are consistent with the idea of niche
conservatism—ancestral phyla that originated under warmer
and wetter conditions may lack the traits that would allow

them to tolerate the cooler and drier conditions more typical
of higher latitudes younger phyla could have evolved a trait
 or suite of traits that conferred cold and drought resistance 

allowing them to colonize higher latitudes unavailable to
older phyla the loss of the zoospore stage is one possible
candidate especially regarding tolerance of drier conditions
 fig in this way the evolutionary histories of fungal taxa
appears to have influenced their distributions across latitudes
at large scales 
the latitudinal gradient in evolutionary age of taxa is com 

mon and has been documented in numerous plant and ani 
mal groups e g buckley et al hawkins et al 
romdal et al moreover some of these studies have
also found evidence for temperature and precipitation rates as
underlying factors hawkins et al romdal et al 
our study suggests that these patterns can apply to microbes
as well as with plant and animals there was overlap in

latitudinal distributions of old vs young fungal groups for
instance the younger fungal phyla were well represented in
soils throughout the latitudinal gradient fig this result is
consistent with others who have recorded ecm fungi
 ascomycota and basidiomycota within the tropics as well as
higher latitudes e g buyck et al tedersoo et al 
in contrast although some taxa from older phyla were found
in the higher latitudes in general the older phyla were better 
represented in the lower latitudes fig in other words the
relative constraint of older phyla to the lower latitudes seems
to be the main driver of differences in latitudinal distributions
among phyla 
we found that the lack of a zoospore stage was more

strongly related to preferences for drier conditions than for

colder temperatures fig so water availability may be a
particularly important constraint for zoosporic phyla zoo

omycota and blastocladiomycota lack cell walls so they are
relatively vulnerable to osmotic shock gleason et al 
james et al among our samples the oldest phylum 
cryptomycota displayed a notable preference for high
precipitation rates fig likewise in a survey of diverse
environmental samples jones et al a found cryptomy 
cota related sequences primarily though not exclusively in
aquatic samples as well as water saturated sediments and
soils an additional consideration is that many zoospores use

ascomycetes and basidiomycetes discharge spores into the air
for wind transport ingold so they may not be as
dependent on standing water for dispersal 
the dikarya are capable of producing regular septa with

central pores that can be closed to prevent leakage fungi with
these structures are more stress tolerant beck et al in
addition numerous members of the dikarya form ecm rela 
tionships with specific host plants e g tedersoo et al 
 this latter trait could also have influenced somewhat
the environmental preferences of dikarya tedersoo et al 
 as the study sites dominated by ecm host plants
tended to occupy higher latitudes and colder habitats table
s however environmental preferences of the dikarya were
not significantly phylogenetically conserved in any case not
for distance from the equator temperature nor precipitation
level fig s thus we found no evidence that the posses 
sion of regular septa by the youngest phyla or their associa 
tions with ecm host plants noticeably influenced their
biogeographical distributions in this study we note that regu 
lar like septa can also be produced by taxa of the kickxellales
and harpellales within kickxellomycotina which is older than
the dikarya tretter et al nevertheless no members of
these groups were detected in our samples they often reside
within insect guts tretter et al and their large scale
distributions in soil remain relatively unexamined 
the loss of the zoospore stage was in general more strongly

related to shifts in environmental preferences than was the
development of regular septa a number of additional physio 
logical and morphological traits distinguish the cryptomycota 
chytridiomycota and blastocladiomycota clades from those
that evolved later e g james et al kumar et al 
 and these traits might each have elicited differences in
environmental preferences the loss of zoospores is just one
possible mechanism in studies that have used culture indepen 
dent techniques to characterize fungal community composition
in high latitudes fungi of the cryptomycota chytridiomycota 
and blastocladiomycota are often much rarer than those of the
dikarya e g deslippe et al taylor et al the
environmental conditions found at higher latitudes might either
directly inhibit activities of older phyla or might provide a
competitive advantage to younger phyla 
the absolute age of fungal phyla is an area of active

research and only broad estimates exist for the oldest clades
 taylor berbee currently the divergence of younger
phyla from the cryptomycota chytridiomycota and blastoc 
ladiomycota clades—and the loss of the zoospore stage—is
thought to have occurred during the neoproterozoic approxi 
mately to ma stajich et al during this time
span multiple ‘snowball earth’ events occurred evans et al 
 smith snowball earths were extreme ice ages 
when mean annual temperatures were below freezing even at
the equator hyde et al widespread glaciation was
rare before this period with the exception of a snowball
earth event in the paleoproterozoic evans et al kopp
et al when fungi had not yet evolved taylor berbee
 thus the neoproterozoic snowball earths might have
subjected ancestral fungi to sustained cold periods that were
unprecedented in their evolutionary history we tentatively
propose that the novel environmental conditions selected for

new clades that possessed protective cell walls throughout
their lifespan 
latitudinal shifts in fungal diversity and community compo 

sition have previously been documented over smaller scales
and for specific fungal groups for example the species
richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi peaks in higher latitudes
and at lower precipitation levels tedersoo et al this
pattern is broadly consistent with our observations as most
ectomycorrhizal fungi belong to the dikarya in contrast the
richness of fungal endophyte communities primarily ascomy 
cota peaks in the tropics where host plant diversity is like 
wise high arnold lutzoni within southern europe 
epiphytic lichen diversity also mostly ascomycota peaks in
latitudes with higher water availability aragon et al 
in a global synthesis kivlin et al reported that lati 
tude temperature and precipitation each significantly influ 
enced the community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungi glomeromycota moreover community compositions
of ericoid fungi and forest soil fungi vary by latitude in wes 
tern china sun et al 
a number of caveats should be considered within the context

of this study first the observed relationships between
environmental preferences and other traits are correlative so
causal mechanisms must be interpreted with caution selection
experiments are a more definitive test of underlying mecha 
nisms and would be a worthwhile next step second although
our complement of study sites is fairly large it does not com 
prehensively represent all environments and geographical
regions within north and south america likewise it is based
solely in the western hemisphere third we focused on soil
fungi environmental controls over the biogeography of aqua 
tic endophytic or epiphytic fungi could be quite different 
fourth our survey did not capture all fungal phyla and did
not include zoopagomycotina kickxellomycotina or the mi 
crosporidia our interpretations are necessarily limited to those
taxa represented in the survey finally we sequenced the s
region because it allowed us to identify taxa from the phylum
to the family level had we targeted the its region its high
degree of sequence variation would have allowed us to resolve
fungal taxa closer to the species level but with the trade off of
lower confidence at the phylum level schoch et al 
in conclusion we found that the evolutionary history of

fungal taxa was related to their biogeographic distribution at
large scales specifically responses to past changes in the
earth’s climate might have determined the latitudinal distribu 
tion of fungal phyla today we propose that extreme ice ages
that occurred early in the history of fungi elicited the evolu 
tion of greater drought or cold tolerance the responsible trait
might be the loss of the zoospore stage in favour of the main 
tenance of protective cell walls throughout the life cycle the
potential underlying mechanism addressed by the tropical
conservatism hypothesis has previously been implicated for
plants and animals our results indicate that it could be even
more broadly applicable across the tree of life
