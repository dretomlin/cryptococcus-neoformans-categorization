collodaria are heterotrophic marine protists that exist either as large colonies composed of hundreds
of cells or as large solitary cells all described species so far harbour intracellular microalgae as
photosymbionts although recent environmental diversity surveys based on molecular methods
demonstrated their consistently high contribution to planktonic communities and their worldwide
occurrence our understanding of their diversity and biogeography is still very limited here we
estimated the s ribosomal dna rdna gene copies per collodarian cell for solitary ± 
small subunit ssu rdna copies and colonial specimens ± ssu rdna copies for
each individual cell within a colony using single specimen quantitative pcr we then investigated
the environmental diversity of collodaria within the photic zone through the metabarcoding survey
from the tara oceans expedition and found that the two collodarian families collosphaeridae
and sphaerozoidae contributed the most to the collodarian diversity and encompassed mostly
cosmopolitan taxa although the biogeographical patterns were homogeneous within each
biogeochemical biome considered we observed that coastal biomes were consistently less diverse
than oceanic biomes and were dominated by the sphaerozoidae while the collosphaeridae were
dominant in the open oceans the significant relationships with six environmental variables suggest
that collodarian diversity is influenced by the trophic status of oceanic provinces and increased
towards more oligotrophic regions

introduction

radiolarians are skeleton bearing marine hetero 
trophic protists belonging to the eukaryotic phylum
retaria which is included within the super group
rhizaria nikolaev et al adl et al 
moreira et al radiolaria encompass 
extant species classified in five well established
orders among which the acantharia possess a
skeleton made of strontium sulfate and the taxopodia 
collodaria nassellaria and spumellaria a skeleton
made of opaline silica suzuki and not as it is
currently impossible to maintain them alive in culture 
most of our knowledge on radiolarians come from

paleontological studies wever et al and less is
known about their actual diversity and ecology in
modern oceans suzuki and not caron 

among radiolarians collodaria are a poorly
studied group in both paleontological and biological
research each collodarian colony is composed of
hundreds to thousands of collodarian cells
embedded in a gelatinous matrix while the solitary
specimens are composed of a single cell the size of
collodarian colonies ranges from a few micrometres
to a maximum recorded of three metres for a
colonial specimen swanberg and harbison 
some collodarian species harbour silicified struc 
tures either as needle like spines or skeleton while
other typically lack any mineral structures naked
collodarian biard et al although our knowl 
edge on their life cycle is still limited the releases of
small – μm flagellate cells reproductive swar 
mers have been reported on several occasions

respect to the feeding behaviour of collodaria and

all species reported so far harbour numerous
symbiotic microalgae photosymbionts mostly
identified as the dinoflagellate brandtodinium nutri 
cula hollande and enjumet probert et al 
 the taxonomical delineation of the different
collodarian species is challenging due to the limited
number of morphological criteria available brandt 
 haeckel however an integrative
morpho molecular approach recently allowed to
better understand the diversity of collodaria and
clearly distinguished monophyletic families
 collosphaeridae collophidiidae and sphaerozoidae 
among collodaria and clades merging solitary
and colonial species biard et al 

so far only a few studies have described the
geographical distribution of collodarian taxa
throughout the world ocean and reported that
collodaria are globally distributed across a large
variety of marine environments pavshtiks and
pan’kova strelkov and reshetnyak 
swanberg they preferentially inhabit the
near surface of oligotrophic waters where they can be
locally abundant from to exceptionally 
colonies m− khmeleva caron and swanberg 
 dennett et al recent in situ estimation
of collodarian abundances highlighted that collo 
daria were the main contributors to the rhizarian
biomass and represent a substantial fraction
of the global carbon standing stock in the upper
 m of the oceans biard et al though
recent studies unravelled the importance of
collodaria in marine ecosystems biard et al 
guidi et al our understanding of the
collodarian biodiversity its extent and distribution 
is still very limited 

in the past decade environmental molecular
diversity surveys based on the s ribosomal rna
 rrna gene regularly highlighted a high diversity
and a relative important contribution of radiolarians
to planktonic communities in marine ecosystems
 countway et al not et al edgcomb
et al and in particular of the collodaria from
photic layers to the bathypelagic regions of the
oceans de vargas et al pernice et al 
similar molecular approaches applied to the ana 
lyses of protist communities collected by sediment
traps also highlighted the important contribution of
collodaria in the particle export to the deep ocean
 amacher et al fontanez et al yet
these studies generally lacked taxonomic resolution 
as no reliable reference database for the s rdna
was available for detailed assignation of collodaria 
and did not consider the quantification of the
collodarian rdna copy number in each cell a
parameter largely variable among marine protists
 zhu et al godhe et al 

in this study we investigated the global biogeo 
graphy of the collodaria across the variety of marine
ecosystems sampled during the tara oceans expedi 
tion pesant et al we also investigated the
relationships between the distribution of collodarian

diversity across a variety of biogeochemical biomes
and a set of environmental variables

fication of collodaria biard et al 

in order to avoid eukaryote contaminations from
preys or microalgal photosymbionts we designed
two collodarian specific primers col f
 ′ carctaggggttggcaaat ′ and col r

designed and optimized using a reference alignment

metabarcoding sample acquisition and processing

the tara oceans expedition supplementary
figure s pesant et al detailed descriptions
of samples used in the present study and their
environmental context are published in open
access at pangaea biard et al the
v s rdna metabarcodes from the tara oceans
expedition – published in open access at
pangaea de vargas et al a b and at the
european nucleotide archive under project acces 
sion number prjeb were extracted for each
sample and processed with a bioinformatics pipeline
previously described de vargas et al briefly 
the pipeline consisted of quality checking 
filtering metabarcodes present in o samples and
witho reads were removed and clustering into
operational taxonomic units otus using the
swarm software mahé et al for the present
analysis we only considered otus with ⩾ 
sequences present in at least two different samples 
this threshold led to the removal of of all
sequences included in the initial data set while it
removed of unique collodarian otus from
this the otus were assigned by comparison to the
protist ribosomal reference pr database guillou
et al modified with the inclusion of new
collodarian reference sequences biard et al 
for otus having contentious assignation for
example several matches with different reference
sequences or low hit score they were classified as
uncertain we finally eliminated the sampling
stations having o samples to homogenize the final
data set 

to determine the most relevant identity threshold
to analyse the collodarian biodiversity we calcu 
lated pairwise identity values for the full length s
rrna gene and its hypervariable regions v and v 
 supplementary figure s using the seqidentity
function implemented in the bio d package grant
et al the reference alignment used for this
analysis comprised collodarian s rdna
sequences available on the genbank database 
representing the most exhaustive collodarian data
set up to date we consequently considered for the

present study only the collodarian otus with ⩾ 
identity to a reference sequence 

data analyses
all data analyses and statistics described below were
performed using r r core team and
the ggplot wickham hmisc harrell 
 and vegan oksanen et al 
packages as well as custom scripts for each
sampling station we did not find significant differ 
ences in otu composition between the four different
size fractions nor the two depths and consequently
pooled all the sequences from different samples
collected in the same sampling station for statistical
analyses of the otu composition and richness 

we created an environmental data set composed of
 environmental variables available online at
pangaea biard et al recorded at the
surface and the dcm to investigate their relation 
ships with the collodarian biodiversity for each
sampling stations we calculated the average value of
the environmental variables recorded between the
surface water and the dcm collodarian diversity
 expressed here as the otu richness as well as
other environmental variables were log transformed
to normalize them and we calculated the pearson
correlation coefficient between pairs of variables 
because of the increased risk of a type i error when
several tests of significance are performed simulta 
neously legendre and legendre we used the
sequential bonferroni adjustment to test the signifi 
cance of the correlation coefficients rice

after filtering a total of quality checked
v rdna gene sequences were assigned to the
rhizaria and further clustered in otus out of
these sequences collodaria accounted for a total of
 sequences and otus based on
relative sequence abundances we estimated that
collodaria contributed for an average of of
the total rhizarian sequences and at least of
the rhizarians otus considering that we applied a
strict cutoff excluding rare otu in this study
 figure collodaria were the dominant lineage
within the rhizaria within all biomes except in the
antarctic biome where three sampling stations
completely lacked collodaria overall variations of
collodarian contribution to the rhizarian sequences
matched very well their contribution to rhizarian
otus except for a few sampling stations for
example station in the indian ocean where
the collodarian contribution to rhizarian otus
was lower than their contribution to rhizarian
sequences 

the latitudinal variations of collodarian otu

centred between and ° s and exhibiting higher
diversity at low latitudes figure a additionally 
the collodarian richness greatly varied within and
between the different biogeochemical biomes

overall the clade a was the most abundant with

we observed that the most abundant otus
were widely spread across the sampling stations
 figure b and that each of the most abundant
were distributed at least in sampling stations
among a total of that is a few other ‘rare’
otus occurred in a limited number of sampling
locations typically being observed in two or three
sampling stations 

the geographical distribution of the different
collodarian families and clades among nine different
biogeochemical regions revealed a rather homoge 
neous distribution with a few clades one or two 

prevailing at each sampling station figure on
average the collosphaeridae appeared dominant
 – in open ocean waters that is ind pac 
nat sat and ant while we observed a rather clear
domination – of the sphaerozoidae at
coastal biomes that is ico pco and aco with the
exception of the mediterranean sea med with an
overall domination of the collosphaeridae 
figure collophidiidae were rare accounting for
o of the collodarian sequences in all biomes 
with the exception of a few sampling stations
 for example and both in the pacific
trade wind biome where they displayed signifi 
cantly higher contribution figure within
each biome the distribution patterns were rather
homogeneous across sampling stations except
for the mediterranean sea where a clear shift
appeared in clade composition when going from
the occidental basin sampling stations – to the
oriental basin – the sphaerozoidae being
dominant in the western part of the sea of
collodarian sequences and replaced by collo 
sphaeridae in the eastern part of collodarian
sequences figure although the collodarian
diversity was low throughout the two basins 
higher diversity was observed locally in three
sampling stations for example and this
higher collodarian diversity consistently occurred
with more even contribution of the two main
collodarian family ratio collosphaeridae sphaero 
zoidae figure

diversity with regards to a set of environmental
variables available for the samples considered

discussion

quantifying the rdna copy numbers
using specifically designed qpcr primers we deter 
mined the number of s rrna gene copies for 
collodarian specimens encompassing three different
species table the times higher s rrna gene
copy number observed between the colonial com 
pared with the solitary specimens could be explained
by the presence of multiple nuclei estimated from 
to nuclei per cells in colonial forms suzuki et al 
 while solitary specimens typically possess a
single nucleus huth anderson suzuki
et al other hypotheses such as the difference
in ploidy between the two forms the solitary being a
haploid stage of the colonial specimens biard et al 
 cannot be ruled out 

the number of rdna copies weighted by the
number of central capsules that is actual number of
cells showed a distribution consistent with that of
other marine protists figure and similar com

the full specimen that is the entire colony colonial

ber ever recorded in any marine protist among the

 colonial specimens we analysed here the highest
number of rdna copies rdna copies 
was recorded for a c pelagicum colony measuring
 × mm mm such high content is similar to
the number of rdna copies estimated in the multi 
cellular crustacean copepod mesocyclops edax
 supplementary figure s wyngaard et al 
as colonial collodarian often display sizes larger
than several centimetres up to a few metres
 swanberg and harbison we estimate that a
 × mm cylindrical colony that is mm 
the size of a colony reported in swanberg and
harbison with a central capsule density of
 capsulemm− dennett et al could
possess almost one billion rdna copies these high
values illustrate the difficulty to quantitatively
appreciate the real significance of collodaria abun 
dance inferred from metabarcoding surveys as they
can potentially lead to an overestimation of their
importance depending on the care with which the
samples have been collected indeed colonial
collodaria are easily broken upon collection with
plankton net or during filtration procedures and
dna signature along with the high rdna copy
content could propagate to smaller size fractions for
example – μm where the high diversity and
contribution of collodaria have been reported on
several occasions not et al sauvadet et al 
 edgcomb et al massana 
although we cannot rule out the impact of cell
breakage in the propagation of collodarian dna the
lack of differences in collodarian otu composition
among the four size fractions collected during the
tara oceans expedition could also be due to
the presence of different collodarian life stages
 for example flagellate reproductive swarmers

efforts will be needed to fully assess the actual

the use of clustering thresholds to limit potential
diversity overestimations from environmental sur

collodaria qpcr estimations of s rrna gene copy

solitary suggested a major difference between
solitary and colonial forms table two forms that
cannot currently be differentiated based on the s

 biard et al in this regards estimations of
central capsule abundance from sequence abun 
dance will be biased until we are able to separate
solitary from colonial forms based on molecular
signature which could potentially be resolved using
more variable marker such as mitochondrial gene
marker leray et al 

insight into the biodiversity and ecology of collodarian
taxonomic assignment of the otus based on a
recent morpho molecular reference framework for
collodaria biard et al did not reveal new
lineages represented by environmental sequences
only at the family level at finer taxonomic resolu 
tion a few dominant otus assigned mostly to the
collosphaeridae and sphaerozoidae were consis 
tently dominant throughout the different sampling
stations suggesting that besides collophidiidae 
collodaria as a whole are likely to be cosmopolitan
organisms figures b and these observations
are consistent with a previous examination of
collodarian biodiversity distribution assessed from
diverse locations suggesting that collodarian species
can be divided into three groups widely
distributed species typically belonging to the collo 
sphaeridae clades a a and a or the sphaer 
ozoidae clade c tropical distributed species
such as clades a b or c confined to the surface
waters and endemics species absent from any
existing morpho molecular databases strelkov and
reshetnyak biard et al the clades
included in the first category were consistently
found being the most abundant throughout the
different sampling stations of the present data set
 figures b and we did not find strong evidence
suggesting the presence of endemic clades even

assignation of environmental sequences mostly
obtained from previous clone libraries surveys 
showed that the collophidiidae were consistently
the dominant collodarian family in deep water
samples biard et al this observation has
been confirmed by a recent study from which a
substantial number of metabarcodes assigned to the
genus collophidium were extracted from deep 
water samples – m acquired worldwide
 pernice et al exploring further this deep 
dwelling collodarian community might change our
understanding of the ecology and diversity of
collodaria in the global ocean 

the observed decrease of collodarian richness
towards high latitudes figure a is not only
consistent with previous analyses strelkov and
reshetnyak but also with other latitudinal
trends observed for radiolarians boltovskoy et al 
 or different marine organisms such as tintin 
nids or copepods dolan et al rombouts
et al when considering biogeochemical
regions defined by longhurst we consistently
observed a higher contribution of sequences
affiliated to sphaerozoidae species mostly lacking
silicified structure biard et al in low 
diversity coastal biomes whereas collosphaeridae
 skeleton bearing taxa biard et al were the
dominant collodarians in the more diverse open 
ocean biomes figures b and similar to our
observations numerous surface sediment records
suggested that collosphaeridae are likely to be
encountered in open ocean waters boltovskoy
et al but the lack of fossil record for
spicule bearing and naked collodaria prevent accu 
rate testing of this distribution pattern 

links between collodarian diversity and environmental
variables
testing the relationships between the collodarian
otu richness within each clade or family with the
 environmental variables available did not provide
any significant linear correlations supplementary
figure s but significant relationships were found
when considering the total collodarian otu richness
instead figure the observed patterns of increas 
ing or decreasing diversity suggest that all three
families with the exception of the collophidiidae

largely under represented displayed the same varia 
tion for the variables considered and that none of the
significant variability affected preferentially one of
the families 

overall both the bathymetry and the distance
from the coast of each sampling station revealed the
highest correlation with otu richness figures
 a and b indicating that the collodarian diversity is
likely to increase towards more oceanic conditions as
it was previously suggested figure b swanberg 
 we also found a positive correlation between
the water column stratification estimated via the
mixed layer depth suggesting that the collodarian
diversity increase with a deeper stratification of the
ocean figure c although the extent of the mixed
layer depth mld is variable over seasons with
deeper stratification in winter and a shallow mld in
summer its extent in tropical regions is rather stable
over time with a deep mld de boyer montégut et al 
 in the present study most of the samples were
collected in tropical regions supplementary
figure s with deep mld suggesting an increasing
diversity toward tropical and oligotrophic regions
where collodaria are known to be more abundant
 dennett et al biard et al such a
pattern was supported by the significant increase of
diversity with decreasing particulate organic carbon
and increasing dcm we found no significant
correlation between otu richness and sea tempera 
ture supplementary table s whereas it has been
suggested earlier that collodarian diversity may
increase towards warmer waters strelkov and
reshetnyak however our sampling coverage
provided only a narrow range of temperature inter 
quartile range °c between and °c and thus
could have limited the significance of temperature in
explaining the diversity patterns observed 

although the silica concentrations were rather low
across the sampling stations and typical of tropical
waters the overall positive correlation between
silica concentration and collodarian diversity
 figure e was unexpected as most collodaria have
reduced silicified structures spines or skeleton or
even lack these structures biard et al 
additionally while we could have expected a
domination of naked sphaerozoidae for example 
collozoum spp in low silica concentration waters 
the analysis of otu composition did not reveal such
a domination but rather suggested that the diversity
of the three collodarian families increased with
increasing silica concentration supplementary
figure s although the decrease of radiolarian
skeleton weight with decreasing silica availability in
surface waters has been previously suggested
through analysis of marine sediments from the
cenozoic that is o million years lazarus et al 
 the present pattern could however indicate
that with increasing silica concentration a large
morphological diversity in particular silicified
collodarian that is spicules and skeleton bearing
species could be encountered

the cosmopolitan distribution of collodarian
families and clades observed in the present study
provide insights into the ecology of collodaria and
suggested that these protists have adapted to various
environmental conditions although we recovered
six significant relationships with different environ 
mental parameters other processes might be
considered to fully understand the distribution of
collodarian diversity such as the influence of
temporal scales as it has been proved to have
potential impacts on plankton diversity rombouts
et al egge et al or including biotic
variables such as predation shurin or photo 
symbiosis biard et al known to affect the
distribution of plankton communities
