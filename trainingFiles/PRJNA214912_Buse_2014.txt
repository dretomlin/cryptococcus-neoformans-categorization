abstract

drinking water dw biofilm communities influence the survival of opportu 

nistic pathogens yet knowledge about the microbial composition of dw bio 

films developed on common in premise plumbing material is limited utilizing

 s and s rrna gene pyrosequencing this study characterized the microbial

community structure within dw biofilms established on unplasticized polyvi 

nyl chloride upvc and copper cu surfaces and the impact of introducing

legionella pneumophila lp and acanthamoeba polyphaga mature year
old biofilms were developed before inoculation with sterilized dw control 

con lp or lp and a polyphaga lpap comparison of upvc and cu bio 

films indicated significant differences between bacterial p and eukary 
otic p members attributable to the unique presence of several family
taxa burkholderiaceae characeae epistylidae goniomonadaceae paramoebidae 

plasmodiophoridae plectidae sphenomonadidae and toxariaceae within upvc

biofilms and enterobacteriaceae erythrobacteraceae methylophilaceae acanth 

amoebidae and chlamydomonadaceae within cu biofilms introduction of lp

alone or with a polyphaga had no effect on bacterial community pro 

files p but did affect eukaryotic members upvc p cu 
p thus established dw biofilms host complex communities that
may vary based on substratum matrix and maintain consistent bacterial com 

munities despite introduction of lp an environmental pathogen 

introduction

biofilms are ubiquitous to drinking water dw distribu 

tion system surfaces and provide microenvironments for

growth of opportunistic bacterial pathogens reviewed in

 berry et al the conventional view is that the

majority of dw microorganisms are released from bio 

films ridgway olson lechevallier et al 

although bulk water microorganisms may predominate

when there is a loss of chlorine residual srinivasan et al 

 somewhat more controversial is the impact of the

inflowing microbiota on what members establish within

dw biofilms pinto et al vs the influence of con 

ditions within a particular system wang et al 

nonetheless public health concerns stem from the

increasing number of legionellosis cases in the united

states hicks et al and the significant health bur 

den arising from these legionella and nontuberculous

mycobacteria collier et al studies evaluating

microbial composition of dw biofilms and environmen 

tal pathogens have primarily focused on the initial

establishment and maintenance of pathogens such as leg 

ionella pneumophila lp within biofilms yet the occur 

rence of free living amoeba fla is also a health

concern as they are reservoirs for lp and other dw envi 

ronmental pathogens harb et al lau ashbolt 

 and have been co isolated from lp contaminated

dw samples specifically the fla acanthamoeba spp 

 yamamoto et al moore et al and verm 

amoeba hartmannella vermiformis thomas et al

smirnov et al buse et al showed that lp colo 

nized mature dw biofilms grown on copper cu more

effectively and shed from those biofilms at a higher fre 

quency and duration compared to unplasticized polyvinyl

chloride upvc grown biofilms suggesting that dw bio 

film microorganisms may have an impact on the coloni 

zation of water based pathogens buse et al 

hence identifying the taxonomic structure of these pro 

karyotic and eukaryotic microbial communities is crucial

to understanding the ecological niches that are permissive

to environmental pathogen development 

microbial community analysis via s and s rrna

gene sequencing has provided insight into community

structure within treated dw and biofilms collected from

different points along the treatment process distribution

system and in premise plumbing specifically microbial

community composition has been assessed for bulk water

isolated after granular activated carbon gac treatment

 poitelon et al from finished water of chlorinated

 poitelon et al otterholt charnock 

and unchlorinated systems valster et al 

lautenschlager et al from several points along

the distribution system lautenschlager et al and

from hospital tinned steel and copper plumbing 

 felf€oldi et al and government copper plumbing 

 buse et al b hot and cold water endpoints the

latter two studies identified amoeba resisting bacteria

 arb and putative nosocomial bacteria acinetobacter

lwoffi corynebacterium tuberculostrearicum escherichia al 

bertii lp and pseudomonas aeruginosa and fla echin 

amoeba thermarmum vermamoeba hartmannella 

vermiformis platyamoeba sp protacanthamoeba bohemi 

ca pseudoparamoeba pagei and vannella sp in the bulk

water 

several studies have assessed bacterial community

diversity within mature chlorinated dw biofilms estab 

lished on pvc pipes from a year old water cooler

 silbaq and year old kitchen drain outlets mcbain

et al stainless steel ss plugs from a model dw

distribution system from to days postestablish 

ment martiny et al galvanized iron pipe wafers

from a model system from to days postestablish 

ment lee et al and a finished concrete and steel

water reservoir for years zhang et al interest 

ingly both sphingomonas and pseudomonas were identi 

fied within in the iron and ss derived biofilms whereas

sphingomonas but not pseudomonas was identified

within the concrete and steel derived biofilms and vice

versa for pvc derived biofilms indicating possible corre 

lations in co occurrence of these two bacteria addition 

ally putative pathogens were only identified within pvc

kitchen drain outlet derived biofilms aeromonas afipia 

e coli klebsiella and pseudomonas were identified and

the concrete and steel derived biofilms bosea shigella 

and streptococcus 

however compared to s rrna gene based commu 

nity analysis little data are available on the eukaryotic

diversity of dw biofilms being largely limited to sand

and gac filters in dw treatment plants and for distal

points along the dw distribution system dwds 

 thomas et al corsaro et al where s

rrna gene sequencing was performed postamoebal enrich 

ment with the dwds samples and thus did not represent

the entire eukaryotic community those studies did report

the occurrence of arb chlamydiae with identification of

a new parachlamydia acanthamoebae strain recovered from

gac biofilm legionellae and mycobacteria and the puta 

tive fla hosts acanthamoeba echinamoeba vermamoeba

 hartmannella and naegleria 

despite all the above work in depth characterization of

these complex dw communities as well as the tandem

use of both s and s rrna gene sequencing is still a

relatively unexplored area that may be alleviated with the

use of next generation sequencing technologies the aim

of this study was to determine the microbial diversity and

relative abundance within dw biofilms that develop

within buildings in premise plumbing to better under 

stand the putative ecological associations between envi 

ronmental water based pathogens their in situ hosts 

and other community members moreover this study

builds on previous observations of differences in lp colo 

nization within cu and upvc dw biofilms by evaluating

differences in community structure which might have

underlying significance on their colonization properties 

this study examined the prokaryotic and eukaryotic com 

munity composition on year old dw biofilms grown
on common in premise plumbing materials upvc and

cu coupon surfaces and the effect of introducing lp and

the fla species a polyphaga to overall microbial com 

munity structure was evaluated

 fig because dw biofilms were allowed to develop

on the upvc and cu surfaces for more than a year before

inoculation this could indicate the resiliency of the estab 

lished biofilms nonetheless inoculation of lpap did

appear to impact eukaryotic community members within

cu dw biofilms p r and upvc dw
biofilms p r fig 

discussion

the key finding from this study was the importance of

the substratum to subsequent bacterial and eukaryotic

biofilm community structure figs and despite

common feed water from a large building copper pipe

in premise plumbing system interestingly cu biofilms

were composed of more betaproteobacteria genera and

displayed less eukaryotic diversity than upvc biofilms 

while bacterial composition was less diverse in upvc

biofilms fig and table this suggests that the upvc

substratum may be more favorable to eukaryotic coloniza 

tion presumably due to the higher biomass productivity

 buse et al additionally was it the presence of

betaproteobacteria or other biofilm members limiting

eukaryotic diversity within cu biofilms or the absence of

the antimicrobial toxic properties of copper within the

upvc biofilms confounding these observations is the

notion that certain biofilm members can readily adhere

and stably colonize biofilms grown on any surface such as

the equally strong colonization of mycobacterium avium 

m intracellulare and m abscessus within glass stainless

steel pvc and zinc galvanized steel coupons grown dw

biofilms mullis falkinham nonetheless from

this study there were clear differences in bacterial and

eukaryotic composition within upvc vs cu dw biofilms

grown on a common in premise source drinking water 

similar to the results from this study bacterial compo 

sition of finished water from a chloraminated dw system

was dominated by the phyla actinobacteria bacteriodetes 

and proteobacteria zeng et al specifically 

sequences with high homologies to the families mycobac 

teriaceae and microbacteriaceae acitinobacteria chitino 

phagaceae bacteriodetes rhodobacteraceae and

sphingomonadaceae alphaproteobacteria comamonada 

ceae and rhodocyclaceae betaproteobacteria and bdell 

ovibrionaceae deltaproteobacteria were the most

abundant in the upvc and cu biofilms tables s and

s moreover the bacterial phyla identified in the cur 

rent study table with the exception of spirochaetes 

have previously been reported for finished water samples

from a nonchlorinated system lautenschlager et al 

 the same nonchlorinated system also contained

the bacterial phyla chlorflexi chlorobi and elusimicrobia 

which were not identified in the current study where the

tank feed water was derived from a chlorinated with

maintained residual distribution system thus not sur 

prisingly the phyla chlamydiae verrucomicrobia acido 

bacteria gemmatimonadetes and nitrospirae were absent

in finished water from a chlorinated treatment plant but

were present upstream in water samples from the gac

beds except gemmatimonadetes poitelon et al 

suggesting that introduction of disinfectants decreases

bacterial diversity however biofilms isolated from a con 

crete steel finished water storage tank immediately down 

stream of a dw treatment plant contained bacteria across

 unique genera zhang et al of which were

identified in this study indicating that biofilms provide

microbial protection from disinfectants and may be a

potential source of environmental pathogens in dw

 wingender flemming 

environmental pathogens identified in dw systems are

usually also arb that exploit the similarities amoebae have

with macrophages to cause respiratory diseases in humans

 lau ashbolt the pathogen containing families

bradyrhizobiaceae mycobacteriaceae and legionellaceae all

of which were identified in this study fig and tables s 

and s have been previously isolated from dw and dw

biofilms thomas et al feazel et al 

mycobacterium and legionella are well studied human

opportunistic pathogens that can cause severe respiratory

diseases collier et al however for the other arb

genera their common isolation from dw systems and

ability to resist amoeba predation make them likely candi 

dates for agents of sporadic disease outbreaks whose etiol 

ogy is unknown yoder et al 

both upvc and cu biofilms contained sequences iden 

tified as the afipia bosea and bradyrhizobium genera

belonging to the family bradyrhizobiaceae with a relatively

higher abundance of sequences found within the cu bio 

films tables s and s this trend was also true for the

genus leptospira belonging to the family leptospiracaea 

members of which are human pathogens and have been

detected via pyrosequencing even though lp specific

qpcr analysis detected it postinoculation in the biofilm

samples analyzed in the study buse et al buse

et al showed that lp colonized cu biofilms more

efficiently especially with the co inoculation of a polyph 

aga than within upvc biofilms thus coupled with the

observation of higher relative abundances of bradyrhizobi 

aceae sequences in cu biofilms compared to upvc bio 

films from the current study tables s and s arbs

and other potential environmental pathogens seem to

prefer colonization within cu biofilms than upvc which

is counterintuitive to the well documented antimicrobial

properties of cu thurman et al 

analysis of similiarity anosim statistical tests

revealed that inoculation of lp and co cultures of lp and

its permissive host a polyphaga only significantly

impacted eukaryotic communities p global r 
 but induced no significant changes in bacterial com 

munities p global r value fig the
relatively low abundance of legionella and acanthamoeba

detected via pyrosequencing in the lp and lpap inocu 

lated biofilms tables s –s and also by qpcr analysis
 table and buse et al suggests their poor and

inefficient colonization into well established mature bio 

films which ultimately contributed to the lack of commu 

nity differences seen in the bacterial profiles across coupon

materials it is possible that the colonization of eukaryotes

within dw biofilms is not as stable and prolific as bacterial

cells eukaryotic taxa identified in this study have also been

identified in previous studies examining community

composition within dw samples poitelon et al 

valster et al otterholt charnock buse

et al b the major eukaryotic groups within dw are

amoebozoa metazoa nematodes rotifers and copepods 

alveolata myzozoa dinoflagellates ciliphora cercozoa 

choanozoa fungi and algae heterokontophyta however 

large scale pyrosequencing of s rrna genes from dw

biofilms is underperformed and further characterization of

these eukaryotes needs to be pursued to fully understand

their biofilm colonization dynamics 

except for s rdna sequences derived from the upvc 

con and upvc lpap biofilms anosim indicated that

within each reactor the s and s rrna gene sequences

for each time group were not significantly different with

p and global r values between � to 
 fig similar to a previous report during the early

stages of dw biofilm development on glass beads and poly 

carbonate coupons bacterial composition fluctuated from

 to months with the stable colonization of mycobacteria 

ceae occurring at months through to the last sampling at

 months revetta et al indicating that after estab 

lishment of a quasi stable microbial structure composition

within biofilms do not significantly change with time asta

observed in the current study it is difficult to determine

which bacterial members and what relative abundance

trends contributed to the statistical significance of time

groups within the upvc con and lpap biofilms that were

absent from all the other biofilm samples fig however 

as stated above these differences can most likely be attrib 

uted to reactor to reactor differences rather than any direct

or indirect effect of inoculating lpap 

in the current study the upvc eukaryotic biofilm com 

munities were more diverse than cu biofilms but the

majority of sequences in both biofilms were identified as

cryptosporidiidae like table tables s and s cu lp

biofilms did not contain any cryptosporidiidae like

sequences even in the day � samples suggesting that the
organisms may not have initially colonized this particular

reactor a majority of the cu lp sequences were not

assigned to any taxon under the parameters used for the

blast assignments thus it is possible that no reference

sequences are available for this particular group of

sequences and represents novel dw biofilm microeukary 

otes the high abundance of the cryptosporidiidae like

sequences is nonetheless concerning as members of this

family are human dw pathogens however phylogenetic

analysis indicates these sequences are taxonomically

distinct from c parvum and c hominis but are a sister

genus to those groups within the family cryptosporidiidae

 data not shown analysis of these putative dw and dw

biofilm indicator sequences is being pursued further as they

were also found to have a high homology to uncultured

eukaryotic sequences previously identified in dw and dw

treatment plants kasuga et al valster et al

the upvc and cu biofilms also contained a high

abundance of vermamoeba hartmannella like

sequences table table s and s v vermiformis is

commonly found in dw and is susceptible to legionella

infectivity where intracellular replication has been

observed in dw samples collected from in premise

plumbing nahapetian et al thus there were

high expectations for lp to colonize the upvc and cu

biofilms postinoculation via parasitization of the permis 

sive indigenous vermamoeba hosts however previous

reports suggest that v vermiformis may not be permis 

sive to all legionella strains with temperature affecting

infectivity wadowsky et al buse ashbolt 

 as well as secreted v vermiformis factors that

could inhibit legionella activity buse et al a 

future studies will examine the dw biofilm colonization

potential of lp strain chicago previously shown to

be v vermiformis submissive at °c buse ashbolt 
 

collectively this work utilized pyrosequencing to

describe both bacterial and eukaryotic communities on

established mature dw biofilms grown on common in 

premise plumbing materials upvc and cu microbial

composition and relative abundance of each group varied

greatly depending on the biofilm growth substrata with

cu surfaces seemingly more conducive for colonization

by putative environmental pathogens overall the results

imply upstream microbial composition impacts down 

stream community composition which has also been pre 

viously observed when evaluating the bacterial

composition for the various dw treatment steps zeng

et al notwithstanding individual reactor differ 

ences however the introduction of lpap appeared to

result in significant differences in the eukaryotic commu 

nities within the dw biofilms the results from this study

further the understanding of dw biofilms and their

potential impacts on human health by beginning to

address questions such as what microorganisms are

indigenous within dw biofilms are certain dw materials

more prone to harbor potential environmental pathogens 

and can introduction of a pathogen host inoculum per 

turb the microbial community
