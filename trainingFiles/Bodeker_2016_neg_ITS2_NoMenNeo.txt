summary

 communities of litter saprotrophic and root associated fungi are vertically separated within

boreal forest soil profiles it is unclear whether this depth partitioning is maintained exclusively

by substrate mediated niche partitioning i e distinct fundamental niches or by competition

for space and resources i e distinct realized niches improved understanding of the mecha 

nisms driving spatial partitioning of these fungal guilds is critical as they modulate carbon

and nutrient cycling in different ways 

 under field settings we tested the effects of substrate quality and the local fungal species

pool at various depths in determining the potential of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi to

colonize and exploit organic matter natural substrates of three qualities – fresh or partly
decomposed litter or humus – were incubated in the corresponding organic layers of a boreal
forest soil profile in a fully factorial design after one and two growing seasons fungal com 

munity composition in the substrates was determined by pyrosequencing and decomposi 

tion was analyzed 

 fungal community development during the course of the experiment was determined to

similar degrees by vertical location of the substrates of explained variation and by sub 

strate quality indicating that interference competition is a strong additional driver of

the substrate dependent depth partitioning of fungal guilds in the system during the first

growing season litter substrates decomposed slower when colonized by root associated com 

munities than when colonized by communities of litter saprotrophs whereas humus was only

slightly decomposed by both fungal guilds during the second season certain basidiomycetes

from both guilds were particularly efficient in localizing and exploiting their native organic

substrates although displaced in the vertical profile this validates that fungal community com 

position rather than microclimatic factors were responsible for observed depth related differ 

ences in decomposer activities during the first season 

 in conclusion our results suggest that saprotrophic and root associated fungal guilds have

overlapping fundamental niches with respect to colonization of substrates of different qualities 

and that their substrate dependent depth partitioning in soils of ectomycorrhiza dominated

ecosystems is reinforced by interference competition through competitive interactions mycor 

rhizal fungi can thus indirectly regulate litter decomposition rates by restraining activities of

more efficient litter saprotrophs

introduction

the boreal forest biome is a globally important carbon c 

sink schlesinger andrews myneni et al 

with rates of photosynthetic c fixation generally exceeding

rates of organic matter decomposition nutrients such as

nitrogen n and phosphorous accumulate below ground

in organically bound forms knicker �agren hyvo 

nen nilsson rendering n availability the main

constraint on tree production tamm traditionally 

substrate quality in terms of lignin and n content and

abiotic factors such as temperature water availability and

soil acidity have been regarded as the main regulators of

litter decomposition rate and persistence of litter derived c

in the soil hobbie et al cornwell et al how 

ever recent studies suggest that above ground litter quality

and climatic factors do not fully explain c sequestration

below ground schmidt et al clemmensen et al

fungi are the principal decomposers of organic matter

and drivers of nutrient cycling in boreal forest ecosystems 

there are two main functional groups of fungi in boreal

forest soils i free living saprotrophic fungi and ii fungi

that are symbiotically associated with plant roots either as

ectomycorrhizal tree associates or in other forms of plant–
fungal interactions for example ericoid mycorrhiza boreal

forest soils are characterized by a low degree of vertical

mixing resulting in distinct stratification into an upper 

most layer of decomposing above ground plant litter a

humus layer of well decomposed organic matter below 

and a clear transition to the underlying mineral soil in

these layers fungal functional groups occupy different spa 

tial niches according to their mode of c assimilation lin 

dahl et al clemmensen et al free living

saprotrophic needle degraders dominate in the litter layer 

where they depend on c and nutrients from freshly fallen

and partly decomposed litter in contrast root associated

fungi including ectomycorrhizal symbionts mainly colo 

nize the more decomposed humus below with their c

supply secured through biotrophic interactions adaptation

of root associated fungi to colonization of substrates

exhausted for easily available c compounds seems plausi 

ble hobbie horton lindahl et al how 

ever whether the depth partitioning of fungal guilds is

maintained exclusively by substrate mediated niche parti 

tioning i e distinct fundamental niches is not established 

the vertical partitioning of free living saprotrophs and

root associated fungi into distinct organic soil layers may

be reinforced by competition for resources leading to

antagonistic interactions and mutual repression such

interactions were first proposed by gadgil gadgil 

 who found increased litter decomposition in

response to exclusion of roots and mycorrhizal fungi 

from litter layers and proposed that the underlying mecha 

nism was suppression of the saprotrophic community by

mycorrhizal fungi competing for water or nutrients later

studies also found retarded litter decomposition koide 

wu or no effects mayor henkel related to

the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi however stimula 

tion of litter degradation by the presence of roots and their

associated fungi has also been observed subke et al 

 lindahl de boer finlay found that sever 

ing of root connections in humus stimulated rapid growth

of opportunistic saprotrophs when competition with

ectomycorrhizal fungi was eliminated direct combative

interactions have also been observed in microcosm experi 

ments where growth and phosphorous acquisition by

saprotrophic fungi were suppressed by ectomycorrhizal

fungi lindahl et al and vice versa leake et al 

 lindahl stenlid finlay 

antagonism driven by competition for space and

resources is an essential determinant of fungal communi 

ties boddy kennedy competition may take

two general forms interference competition when organ 

isms affect each other directly or exploitation competition

when organisms affect each other indirectly through deple 

tion of a pool of common resources keddy 

although the eco physiological capacity of a functional

group that is its fundamental niche may be wide compe 

tition may restrict its occurrence to a smaller realized

niche changing climatic conditions atmospheric co 
levels forest management regimes and nutrient availability

may affect fungal functional guilds differentially leading

to shifts in their competitive balance and realized niches if

decomposer capacities are fundamentally different between

the guilds such shifts could result in changes in ecosystem

c and nutrient dynamics fernandez kennedy 

mycorrhizal fungi have generally not been considered to

be efficient decomposers of organic matter the large sur 

face area of their extra radical mycelium has been inter 

preted as an adaptation to optimize uptake of mineralized

nutrients from the soil solution however in many low 

productive boreal forest ecosystems nutrients are primar 

ily bound in organic complexes while inorganic nutrients

are scarce aerts northup et al therefore 

organic nutrient mobilization and a more active involve 

ment of mycorrhizal fungi in decomposition of organic

matter are increasingly discussed entry donnelly cro

ectomycorrhizal fungi were found to possess genetic poten 

tial to produce class ii peroxidases – extracellular enzymes
that are efficient in lignin decomposition b€odeker et al 

 these genes were actively transcribed at low n

availability under field conditions and peroxidase activity

could be linked to the presence of certain ectomycorrhizal

taxa in boreal forest humus b€odeker et al certain

mycorrhizal fungi may thus decompose organic matter 

supposedly to access organically bound nutrients orwin

et al b€odeker et al lindahl tunlid 

however the relative importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi

and free living saprotrophs as decomposers of organic

material and their role in c turnover remain poorly under 

stood partly because studies of niche differentiation under

natural conditions in the field are challenging 

here we investigate the drivers of the vertical partition 

ing as well as the fundamental niches of saprotrophic and

root associated fungal communities with respect to their

potential to colonize and exploit organic substrates of dif 

ferent qualities we incubated fungal ingrowth bags with

two needle litter qualities or humus reciprocally in the cor 

responding litter or humus layers in a fully factorial

design we aimed to test if insertion of ingrowth bags of

limited size into specific soil layers would promote colo 

nization by fungal communities native to these soil layers

irrespective of substrate quality that is that spatial place 

ment in the soil profiles rather than substrate quality

would be decisive for fungal communities such an effect

of spatial placement rather than substrate quality on fun 

gal communities colonizing displaced substrates would

indicate that interference competition is a strong driver of

the vertical partitioning of fungal communities in the sur 

rounding soil system also by manipulating the spatial

organization of natural substrates the experiment aimed

at investigating the capacity of litter and root associated

fungal groups to exploit substrate qualities outside their

usually realized niches i e their fundamental niches 

thus we explored two sets of hypotheses first we tested

whether h substrate quality alone determined fungal

community composition or whether h placement in dis 

tinct organic horizons also affected fungal community

composition secondly given expected effects of incuba 

tion depth on communities we tested whether h all fun 

gal communities had similar decomposer capacities and

decomposition rate was determined exclusively by sub 

strate quality or whether h incubation depth also

affected decomposition rate with saprotrophic communi 

ties being the most efficient litter decomposers and root 

associated communities being the most efficient exploiters

discussion

compet it ion re inforces vert ical substrate 

dependent part it ion ing of saprotrophic

versus mycorrhizal fungal gu ilds

in this field experiment we investigated the fundamental

and realized capacities of saprotrophic and root associated

fungal communities to explore and exploit organic matter

of different qualities this was achieved by placing natural

organic substrates of different qualities into distinct hori 

zons of the organic soil profile of a boreal forest after the

first growing season the substrates were primarily colo 

nized by the fungal community native to each horizon 

irrespectively of their quality substrates placed in the sur 

face litter layers were colonized by free living saprotrophs 

whereas substrates placed into the humus layer were colo 

nized by mycorrhizal and other root associated fungi 

within litter layers there was a clear succession of species

from the surface to the more degraded litter just above the

f horizon this vertical distribution of fungal communities

generally mirrored that typical for boreal forest soils lin 

dahl et al clemmensen et al thus the inher 

ent vertical stratification of fungal communities in the soil

profile appeared to have partly overridden effects of sub 

strate quality on fungal communities in the bags this

result demonstrates the potential of both fungal guilds to

colonize all substrates and suggests that their colonization

under natural circumstances is restricted by competitive

interactions after two growing seasons however sub 

strate quality became a more important predictor of fungal

community composition as certain members from each of

the guilds were able to establish in their ‘native’ substrate

although placed at the ‘wrong’ depth as a result the over 

all variation in fungal communities during the course of

the experiment was determined to similar degrees by place 

ment into distinct soil layers of explained variation 

and by substrate quality this confirms our first

alternative hypothesis and indicates that interference com 

petition and monopolization of spatial domains play a

more important role in structuring fungal communities at

small scales than previously thought the small distance

 few cm among the soil layers in which substrates were

incubated makes it unlikely that dispersal limitation peay 

garbelotto bruns per se could have caused the

effect of placement unless reinforced by interference

competition in natural ectomycorrhiza dominated forest

ecosystems preferred substrates and territorial distribution

of these fungal guilds coincide and competition appears to

reinforce niche separation by substrate and stabilize verti 

cal community stratification 

decomposer community composit ion and

substrate qual ity exert independent

controls on organic matter decomposit ion

and n dynamics

decomposition of the two litter substrates depended on

their placement in the organic soil profile and after the

first season more remained of litters placed in the humus

layer than of litters placed in litter layers we used the first

ordination axis from the ca to express variation in fungal

communities as a single continuous variable this index

explained similar proportions of total variation in decom 

poser activities as vertical placement suggesting that the

biotic component that is the fungal community composi 

tion of vertical placement was the main determinant of

decomposition activities rather than depth related differ 

ences in abiotic factors such as moisture or temperature 

this was further supported by the observation that both

respiration and mass loss were unaffected by placement

depth during the second growing season when fungal indi 

viduals from each functional guild had colonized ‘their

native’ substrates irrespective of placement our two indi 

cators of decomposition activity showed similar patterns

across samples with instantaneous respiration being

indicative of longer term integrated mass loss hence in

support of our second alternative hypothesis root asso 

ciated fungi appeared to decompose litter substrates less

efficiently than free living litter saprotrophs which is con 

sistent with previous observations in axenic laboratory

microcosms colpaert vantichelen 

during evolution of current fungal diversity many root 

associated fungi may partly have lost their capacity to pro 

duce plant cell wall degrading enzymes while acquiring

biotrophic capacities kohler et al this evolution

could have concurred with their exclusion from substrates

with high cellulose contents due to inferior competitive

strength compared to free living saprotrophs in such sub 

strates instead root associated fungi have a secured c

supply from their hosts smith read and do not

depend on an external source of c for energy and biomass

production hence they may exploit organic substrates

selectively for n and other nutrients read perez mor 

eno talbot allison treseder b€odeker et al 

 without necessarily causing mass loss as such our

experiment provides evidence that root associated and

saprotrophic fungal guilds affect n dynamics of decompos 

ing organic matter differently – when litter was exposed
to root associated fungal communities in humus layers n

was lost from the substrate in contrast when litter sub 

strates were colonized by their native fungal community 

n appeared to be transported into the decomposing sub 

strate at early stages of decomposition and was lost only

after the second growing season such pattern has been

observed in other studies of c and n dynamics in decom 

posing litters staaf berg boberg et al and

our data support that it could be caused by the allocation

of n by saprotrophic fungi from older litter substrates to

newly fallen litter with a surplus of available c further 

more mycelial reallocation of n between substrates of dif 

ferent qualities may have stimulated decomposition

activities in the early phases boberg et al these

observations are consistent with the presence of a ‘gadgil

effect’ leading to deprived saprotrophic litter decomposi 

tion caused by mycorrhizal competition for n gadgil 

gadgil at least during the early litter decom 

position phases 

manipulation of location and consequently of fungal

communities did not have major influences on decomposi 

tion and n dynamics of humus substrates and our experi 

ment suggests that in this system neither root associated

fungi nor free living saprotrophs were particularly efficient

humus decomposers and humus accumulation seems to

have been more driven by low quality than by limited

access by decomposer communities thus given its stabil 

ity longer incubation times may be needed to evaluate

community effects on mass loss and nutrient dynamics of

humus substrates and based on the present study we can 

not resolve whether competitive interactions between fun 

gal guilds such as the gadgil effect are important for

long term soil c storage as suggested by earlier theoretical

 orwin et al and data driven analyses averill 

turner finzi nonetheless taken together our

experiment provides evidence in line with recent ideas

 hattenschwiler tiunov scheu schmidt et al 

 that organic matter quality is not the only factor

structuring communities and activities of decomposer

organisms and corresponding effects on c and n turnover 

bas id iomycetes of both fungal guilds br idge

heterogeneous substrates

after the second harvest litters were almost equally

decomposed irrespective of whether incubated in the

humus or in litter layers in spite of the slower decomposi 

tion during the beginning of the experiment and the appar 

ent differences in n dynamics at this time a recognized

saprotrophic litter decomposer mycena galopus had suc 

ceeded to colonize all replicates of litter containing bags

placed in the humus and the presence and activity of this

species may explain the high decomposer activity observed

after months of incubation mycena species were earlier

observed to be efficient in vertical exploration and translo 

cation of resources frey et al frey six elliott

 boberg et al furthermore after the second

growing season the ectomycorrhizal fungi tylospora fibril 

losa and piloderma sphaerosporum as well as several species

of lower abundance managed to locate and proliferate in

humus substrates even when placed in the litter layers 

thus ectomycorrhizal fungi supported by host derived c 

may be superior competitors for humus substrates depleted

in high quality c substrates these findings further support

that substrate quality strongly influences the longer term

competitive outcome between saprotrophic and mycor 

rhizal fungal guilds reinforcing their vertical stratification

in natural forest soils furthermore different ectomycor 

rhizal fungi showed clearly different colonization patterns

depending on both substrate quality and the depth at

which the substrates were incubated this probably reflects

vertical niche separation within ectomycorrhizal fungal

communities and substrate dependent competitive out 

comes between ectomycorrhizal fungi taylor et al 

mujic et al much like we find at the fungal guild

level in the present study these observations also suggest

that basidiomycetes regardless of ecological strategy are

better adapted to spatially explore and allocate resources

in a heterogonous environment boddy lindahl 

olsson than ascomycetes which largely followed

placement depth in the present experiment 

disturbances favour opportunist ic yeasts

and moulds

particularly after the first growing season there was a sub 

stantial colonization of all substrates by opportunistic

saprotrophs these fungi are normally present only at low

abundance in undisturbed forest soils but may proliferate

after disturbances lindahl de boer finlay clem 

mensen et al their relative abundance decreased

over the course of the second growing season and this

transient colonization by opportunists was probably a

response to the sudden availability of un colonized sub 

strate with high concentration of low molecular weight

compounds released during the substrate preparation and

sterilization process even humus substrates lost about 

of initial mass during the first growing season indepen 

dently of incubation depth presumably corresponding to a

pool of easily degradable substrates locked up in micro 

biota or deposited in inaccessible microsites before initial

substrate collection interestingly each horizon appeared

to have a distinct set of opportunists colonizing the new

substrates suggesting that these communities are ecologi 

cally relevant after disturbances in the system the litter

bag approach has been promoted as a more realistic alter 

native than laboratory experiments for decomposition

studies however it is important to recognize that any dis 

turbances tend to favour opportunistic r strategic micro 

organisms over k strategic organisms potentially affecting

processes 

ecosystem scale consequences

our study highlights that the two major fungal guilds in

the boreal forest – free living saprotrophs and root asso 
ciated fungi – have overlapping fundamental niches but
differ with respect to their decomposition capacity thus 

environmental changes influencing the competitive balance

between these fungal guilds may shift their realized niches 

potentially affecting decomposition on the ecosystem scale 

increased c allocation to root associated fungi due to

increased photosynthesis and or in response to plant nutri 

ent deficiency may render root associated fungi more com 

petitive expanding their territory into fresher resources at

the expense of free living saprotrophs potentially decreas 

ing litter mass loss c f averill turner finzi 

however it should be recognized that some ectomycor 

rhizal fungi in nutrient poor forests for example cortinar 

ius spp may actively participate in decomposition of

recalcitrant organic matter by producing oxidative

enzymes b€odeker et al therefore it is not

possible to draw general conclusions about decomposer

capacity across all ectomycorrhizal fungi as they are likely

to vary greatly in their capacities for producing various

enzymes the present study performed in a relatively

nutrient rich boreal forest with only one cortinarius sp 

among identified species points in the direction that envi 

ronmental changes that favour root associated fungi such

as elevated co treseder would lead to increased

c sequestration from plant litter in the soil orwin et al 

 contrastingly in line with gadgil gadgil 

environmental changes that disfavour root associated

fungi and favour free living saprotrophs such as clear 

cutting would stimulate loss of soil c due to eliminated

influence by root associated fungi
