numerous studies have applied molecular techniques to understand the diversity 
evolution and ecological function of antarctic bacteria and archaea one common
technique is sequencing of the s rrna gene which produces a nearly quantitative
profile of community membership however the utility of this and similar approaches
is limited by what is known about the evolution physiology and ecology of surveyed
taxa when representative genomes are available in public databases some of this
information can be gleaned from genomic studies and automated pipelines exist
to carry out this task here the paprica metabolic inference pipeline was used to
assess how well antarctic microbial communities are represented by the available
completed genomes the ncbi’s sequence read archive sra was searched for
antarctic datasets that used one of the illumina platforms to sequence the s rrna
gene these data were quality controlled and denoised to identify unique reads then
analyzed with paprica to determine the degree of overlap with the closest phylogenetic
neighbor with a completely sequenced genome while some unique reads had perfect
mapping to s rrna genes from completed genomes the mean percent overlap for
all mapped reads was when samples were grouped by environment some
environments appeared more or less well represented by the available genomes for
the domain bacteria seawater was particularly poorly represented with a mean overlap
of while for the domain archaea glacial ice was particularly poorly represented
with an overlap of only for a single sample these findings suggest that a
considerable effort is needed to improve the representation of antarctic microbes in
genome sequence databases

introduction

the antarctic continent represents a complex mosaic of microbial habitats at the continental
margin are highly productive coastal seas which transition sharply to the oligotrophic southern
ocean tidewater glaciers and ice shelves bridge the gap between the terrestrial and marine
environments while – along with terrestrial glaciers – providing unique microbial habitats in
cryoconite holes melt ponds and subglacial lakes and streams the complex topography of
antarctica provides for polar deserts and meltwater lakes varying in salinity from nearly fresh
to near saturation this environmental complexity and the isolation of the antarctic from other
continents has inspired over years of microbiological research mclean however only

bowman microbial dark matter

in the last few decades have dna sequencing and other
molecular methods allowed for the genetic and phylogenetic
characterization of single celled members of the domains
eukarya bacteria and archaea 

sequencing of the s rrna gene has emerged as the de
facto standard for determining the diversity of bacterial and
archaeal communities although the maximum resolution of a
diversity analysis by s rrna gene sequencing is insufficient
to identify many phylogenetically similar but genetically distinct
strains community structure derived from s rrna gene
sequencing does indicate the genetic structure of the community
 bowman and ducklow the efficacy of s rrna
gene sequencing studies has been improved in recent years
by the stabilization of standard methods around the illumina
miseq sequencing platform which provides high quality high
throughput sequencing of relatively short amplicons further
aiding microbial diversity analysis are improved primers that
broadly amplify across the domains bacteria and archaea
 walters et al and new methods to denoise illumina
miseq data callahan et al amir et al these
methods allow microbial community structure to be resolved to
the level of unique reads 

despite the inaccessibility of much of the antarctic continent 
there have been numerous efforts to assess the taxonomic and
genetic diversity of antarctic microbial habitats scientific work
following an initial assessment of microbial community structure
in a given antarctic environment may be limited however 
by the availability of completed genomes and model strains 
these are necessary to fully understand the evolution adaptation 
and physiology of antarctic microbes microbial clades that
may be coarsely identified taxonomically but for which little is
known about their genetics physiology and ecological role are
considered “microbial dark matter” marcy et al and are
good targets for new studies and technological innovations 

to provide a status report on our understanding of antarctic
microbial diversity and the extent of microbial dark matter in
different antarctic environments the available illumina miseq
studies were aggregated by environment reanalyzed to the level
of unique sequences and a phylogenetic placement approach
 matsen et al was applied to compare sequence identity to
those closest completed genomes available in the public genbank
repository the phylogenetic distance between environmental
sequence reads and the closest completed genome provides
an estimate of uncharacterized microbial diversity in these
samples and a novel view of the extent of microbial dark
matter in antarctic environments and the putative taxonomy of
uncharacterized microbes 

materials and methods

datasets were identified on the ncbi sra by search with the
following syntax antarctica all fields and x metagenome
 organism where x was an environment deemed relevant
to antarctica these included “aquatic ” “freshwater ” “glacier ”
“hypersaline lake ” “ice ” “lake water ” “marine ” “marine
sediment ” “metagenome ” “microbial mat ” “rock ” “salt

lake ” “seawater ” “sediment ” “soil ” “soil crust ” “snow ” and
“terrestrial ” the goal of this search was not to carry out an
exhaustive search for antarctic datasets but to capture nearly
all the datasets available on sra to confirm the completeness
of this search an additional google scholar search was carried
out using the search terms “antarctica” and “illumina ” the first
 hits were reviewed for any studies that were not captured
in the sra search studies that used repositories other than sra
were not included 

run tables were aggregated for all search results and filtered
to include only amplicon studies that relied on the illumina
miseq or hiseq platforms samples that were derived from host
environments were also excluded from further analysis runs that
were obviously the result of amplification of genes other than the
 s rrna gene e g s rrna genes and intergenic transcribed
spacer regions were removed as were studies where the data
were clearly not demultiplexed when it was uploaded to the
sra the remaining runs were downloaded using the fastq dump
command from the ncbi’s sra toolbox with the – split spots
and – skip technical flags here and elsewhere gnu parallel was
used to parallelize operations tange 

the consensus environment for each downloaded run was
determined by evaluating the run metadata and when available 
any papers citing the run study or bioproject accession number 
because of ambiguity between freshwater lake sediments 
hypersaline lake sediments and marine sediments e g samples
associated with prjna all sediments were classified as
“sediment ”

because not all of the data were derived from paired 
end runs and many read pairs could not be merged only
the forward read was considered in this analysis quality
control of the forward reads was carried out with the dada 
package callahan et al in r r core team 
reads were trimmed at the first position with a quality score
below reads with fewer than bases were discarded 
and the remaining reads denoised unique non redundant 
reads were evaluated to determine their taxonomic domain
using the cm scan function in infernal nawrocki and eddy 
 against covariance models for the domains eukarya 
archaea and bacteria downloaded from the rfam database
 nawrocki et al reads were assigned the domain for
which they received the lowest e value only reads identified
as belonging to the archaea and bacteria were considered
further 

the bacterial and archaeal reads associated with each run
were analyzed using the paprica pipeline bowman and ducklow 
 paprica uses infernal nawrocki and eddy and
pplacer matsen et al to place query reads on a
phylogenetic tree constructed from full length s rrna genes
extracted from completed genomes in genbank in this way 
paprica makes a direct association between the query reads and
the nearest phylogenetic neighbor with a completed genome 
this association was used to make inferences about the degree
of microbial dark matter present within different antarctic
environments the paprica database used in this study was
created on august and thus includes completed genomes
that were available in genbank on that date the unique flag was

results

this study identified valid sra runs that passed the
selection criteria supplementary table s these runs were
associated with bioprojects and consisted of total
forward reads of these runs had reads associated with
the domains bacteria and archaea reads failed qc
while an additional reads could not be assigned to a
domain at the specified cutoff after qc and domain assignment
the analyzed runs contained reads 
bacteria and archaea consensus environments for
runs pulled from the run metadata and publications included
cryoconite n glacial ice n lake n 
lake ice n rock n seawater n sea
ice n sediment n subglacial lake n 
snow n and soil n figure and table 
samples associated with some bioprojects could not be used
because of archival errors these included prjna frisia
et al which lacked quality data and prjna 
and prjna no citations available which were not
demultiplexed 

the number of unique reads varied widely between
environment and was strongly correlated with the number
of samples for archaea and bacteria figure and table 
for bacteria the number of samples associated with a given
environment accounted for of the variance in the number
of unique sequences across environments pearson correlation 
p some environments however had a higher number
of unique reads than anticipated by this model these included
environments with very few samples including snow subglacial
lake lake ice and soil for archaea the number of samples
accounted for of the variance the number of unique reads
 pearson correlation p similar to bacteria snow 
subglacial lake lake and soil had a higher number of unique
reads than predicted by sample number 

the “map ratio” variable calculated by pplacer matsen
et al as the percent identity between the query read
and reference sequence was used as the primary indicator of
how well s rrna gene reads were represented by completed
genomes in genbank i e the paprica database the mean
map ratio distribution by sample limited to samples with more
than reads assigned to the bacteria or archaea was used
to identify environments that may have microbial communities
more poorly represented by completed genomes of bacteria
 figure and archaea figure mean map ratios ranged
from srr soil to srr cryoconite 
for bacteria and from srr glacial ice to 
 srr sediment for archaea samples with more than
 reads but a mean map ratio below were flagged for
further investigation for bacteria these included samples from
cryoconite n lake n lake ice n seawater
 n snow n sediment n and soil n 
environments for the archaea these included samples from

glacial ice n lake n snow n sediment n 
and soil n 

the relationship between the abundance of unique reads
 across the entire dataset and map ratio figure and
table was used to identify unique reads that were abundant
in individual samples but poorly represented by completed
genomes unique reads for which the map ratio was less
than × read abundance were flagged for
further inspection these parameters were selected arbitrarily
to objectively subset a manageable number of reads for
bacteria unique reads met this criterion while 
unique reads met this criterion for archaea the most
abundant phylogenetic edges branches or tips within any
environment associated with these unique reads were evaluated
further to determine which sequenced genomes represent
groups with considerable uncharacterized diversity table 
the most abundant low map ratio edge for domain bacteria
accounted for total seawater reads and placed with
sulfitobacter pseudonitzschia smr represented by genbank
genome gcf classification of a representative
sequence using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier
 wang et al identified the read as belonging to the
phylum proteobacteria the most abundant low map ratio edge
for domain archaea accounted for of total soil reads
and belonged to the family haloarculaceae rdp classified a
representative read as domain archaea 

as seen in the distribution of abundant unique reads with
low map ratios table the uncharacterized diversity for the
bacteria was most pronounced in seawater this is interesting
given that the mean map ratio for seawater samples was not
particularly low individual samples with lower values were
found in lake and soil environments figure in seawater low
map ratios were balanced by abundant well characterized taxa
with high map ratios particularly pseudoalteromonas spongiae
ust map ratio candidatus pelagibacter
ubique htcc map ratio and alteromonas
stellipolaris lmg map ratio a precise classification
of the low map ratio reads was not possible – as is expected for
microbial dark matter – and in most cases the rdp classifier
could not provide a classification below the level of domain 
s pseudonitzschia smr the edge in seawater samples that had
the lowest mean map ratio was relatively abundant and correctly
classified by rdp as belonging to the proteobacteria 

although lake ice and soil environments generally had
high mean map ratios for bacteria some samples from these
environments were unusually low figure for lake ice 
sample err from bioproject prjeb was a clear
outlier with a mean map ratio of although this sample
had enough reads associated with the domain bacteria to be
considered for the mean map ratio analysis n the
sample was of very low diversity with only seven unique reads
identified all of these unique reads had fairly high map ratios
except for one abundant read that placed with halomonas
chromatireducens agd the soil sample with the lowest map
ratio srr bioproject prjna also had relatively
few reads n but was comparatively diverse with 
unique reads the most abundant among these belonged to

discussion

the domains bacteria and archaea showed surprising differences
in their relative abundance and in the number of unique
sequences identified overall bacteria were better sampled than
archaea though this does not necessarily reflect any greater
ecological importance in many environments only recently have
primers been designed to broadly amplify across both domains
 walters et al prior to this many studies focused on
the domain bacteria as a matter of expediency thus while no
archaeal reads were identified in lake ice and sea ice and very
few in glacial ice and snow this does not mean that archaea were
absent from those physical samples archaea were comparatively
well sampled in sediment and soil – environments that are
known to host a considerable number of archaea – but the

number of unique reads associated with the archaea in these
environments was nearly an order of magnitude less than the
number associated with the domain bacteria despite a similar
number of sampled reads this may reflect an overall lower
phylogenetic diversity among the archaea or an analysis artifact 
with the available primers and covariance models insufficient to
capture the true archaeal diversity the lack of archaeal sequence
data was particularly pronounced for seawater where archaea are
known to play a considerable role in the marine nitrogen cycle
and in dark carbon fixation tolar et al 

a key distinction between the bacteria and archaea in this
analysis was the impact of read normalization on read abundance 
the paprica pipeline normalizes read abundance by dividing
the number of reads placed to an edge on the phylogenetic
reference tree by the anticipated s rrna gene copy number

consensus environment i e each unique read may be tallied more than once in different consensus environments the distribution of data is displayed via a
hexagonal density plot with the color of the hexagons representing the density of the data 

for that position on the tree because many bacteria and archaea
have multiple copies of the s rrna gene this can have
a major impact on the estimated abundance of these clades 
across the soil samples for example × reads were
associated with the domain bacteria and × with archaea 
after normalization only × reads were associated with
bacteria a reduction while × were associated
with archaea a reduction table extrapolating these ratios

to a hypothetical single sample suggests that the abundance of
bacteria relative to archaea would be overestimated by a factor of
nearly if the data were not normalized 

while lake and glacial ice had the highest mean map ratios
for bacteria and lake the highest for archaea no antarctic
environment was well represented by the available completed
genomes in genbank all of the investigated environments had
some samples with comparatively low mean map ratios and

abundance values include only those reads with low map ratios not all reads placed to the indicated edge taxonomy of the phylogenetic edge on the paprica reference
tree classification of a representative read for that edge using the ribosomal database project classifier wang et al with a cutoff 

all samples had some number of unique reads with low map
ratios the abundance of a s pseudonitzschia smr phylotype
with a low map ratio in seawater samples indicates that even
relatively well sampled ranked th out of for number of
samples per environment environments contain considerable
uncharacterized diversity s pseudonitzschia was isolated from
the marine diatom pseudonitzschia multi series hong et al 
 suggesting that phytoplankton blooms – comparatively
well studied environments – may host their own microbial
dark matter it is important to note the difference between
phylogenetic dissimilarity and sequence identity for such well 
characterized taxa as sulfitobacter an uncharacterized strain

may be most closely related to e g sequenced sulfitobacter
but nonetheless share little sequence identity overall the
dissimilarity between environmental sequence reads and s
rrna genes from completed genomes is not surprising given
the paucity of completely sequenced genomes from antarctica 
because data on isolation environment is not typically included
with genome metadata it is difficult to determine how many
complete genomes of antarctic bacteria and archaea have been
sequenced however bowman recently identified only
 completely sequenced psychrophile genomes suggesting that
bacteria and archaea from the perennially cold antarctic are not
well represented

a great number of valuable studies were excluded from
this analysis based on technical limitations including the use
of older sequencing technologies such as roche or poor
sequence quality the rate of technological innovation for
high throughput sequencing methods has been extreme since
the first sequencing study in sogin et al 
and the current primers and illumina miseq methodologies
reflect a maturation of this technology e g thompson et al 
 although widely adopted these methodologies are
not ubiquitous however and individual investigators must
strive to adopt best practices for microbial ecology studies 
methodological errors are compounded by archival errors 
several studies of interest could not be used because the data
were not correctly uploaded to sra the most common error
made was not demultiplexing at the time of submission without
a map file identifying barcodes and sample specific metadata
these data are meaningless to the wider community journals and
funding agencies should continue to require that sequence data
and appropriate metadata be archived at the time of manuscript
submission or at the completion of a project however the current
checks are insufficient to insure that data is discoverable and
reusable 

despite the vast size of the antarctic continent sampling
for most environments was concentrated in just a few areas
 figure the western antarctic peninsula and mcmurdo
regions were the most heavily sampled and accounted for
nearly all terrestrial samples except for soil soil was sampled
in several other locations in eastern antarctica namely prydz
bay and in the sor røndane mountains sea ice was sampled
exclusively in the ross sea region including mcmurdo sound 
and the weddell sea how much microbial diversity remains
undiscovered because of this bias is a difficult question to
answer certainly within these more densely sampled sites there
are habitats in space and time that are undersampled or that
have not been sampled at all the implications of this is clear
from the relationships in figure while individual samples
within environments may be sampled to saturation this does not
necessarily mean that the total diversity of the environment is

well sampled future investigations will need to continue to focus
on better understanding the environmental drivers of diversity
within more heavily sampled regions while expanding to include
new areas that have not been included in previous sampling
efforts
