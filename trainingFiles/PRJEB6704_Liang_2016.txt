rhizosphere microbial communities play an essential role in determining plant productivity particularly
in agriculturally marginal environments perennial plants like switchgrass panicum virgatum are
thought to particularly influence microbial community composition and function within their rhizo 
sphere we compared microbial communities in switchgrass rhizospheres and their associated bulk soils
in two regions of the u s upper midwest michigan and wisconsin with contrasting soil types and at
two site types with differing switchgrass establishment ages and management intensities we charac 
terized microbial communities with a range of culture independent methods including amplicon
sequencing of s s rrna and nifh genes and membrane lipid profiling in addition we quantified
abundances of soil amino sugars a time integrative indicator of microbial necromass we found that
amino sugar contents and microbial lipid profiles differed between rhizosphere and bulk soils while
dna based assays did not provide this discriminatory power differences between rhizosphere and bulk
soils were not significantly affected by region or site type rhizosphere soils had higher microbial lipid
abundances particularly those associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and gram negative bacteria 
while amino sugar abundances decreased in the rhizosphere our findings suggest switchgrass rhizo 
spheres systematically stimulate microbial growth and microbial residue turnover

 introduction

to sustainably accommodate growing demand for both food and
biologically based fuels it will be necessary to tap into and
augment biomass production from agriculturally marginal lands
 gelfand et al beneficial microbial interactions in plant
rhizospheres will be essential to achieving adequate plant pro 
ductivity in these environments johansson et al novel
molecular methodologies have granted new insights into the na 
ture and composition of rhizosphere microbial communities
 philippot et al although our knowledge of this complex
system is far from complete frank and groffman further

improving our understanding of bioenergy crop rhizosphere com 
munities will facilitate development of sustainably productive 
biologically based fuel systems 

the plant rhizosphere is a highly dynamic environment within
the soil milieu with much of the activity revolving around ex 
changes of energy and nutrients root exudation and rhizodeposi 
tion furnish labile carbon supporting increased microbial biomass
and turnover joergensen bu�ee et al which spurs
mineralization of soil organic matter and stable residues speeding
nutrient turnover and potentially increasing nutrient availability
 kuzyakov many plants notably warm season perennial
grasses form symbiotic relationships with arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungi amf that can provide their hosts with greater access to
phosphorus nitrogen and other key resources gianinazzi et al 
 a growing body of evidence indicates some potential bio 
energy crop species may supplement their nitrogen supply through
associations with nitrogen fixing bacteria steenhoudt and

while the species of the host plant plays a major role in shaping
rhizosphere communities factors such as soil type and manage 
ment activities also contribute to determining microbial commu 
nity composition and functionality garbeva et al berg and
smalla it is thus necessary to understand not only how a
crop s rhizosphere affects its associated microbiota but also how
that effect varies among soil and management contexts 

in this study we explore how the effects of switchgrass panicum
virgatum l rhizospheres on their associated microbial commu 
nities are altered by soil type and agronomic management in 
tensity the study was conducted in two regions in the u s upper
midwest with comparable climate but distinct soil types soils from
the michigan mi region have significantly higher sand contents
and lower fertility than those in the wisconsin wi region jesus
et al in each region we contrasted two site types inten 
sive sites in each state where switchgrass was recently established
in replicated adjacent plots and was fertilized and harvested
annually and extensive sites located in different areas through both
states where switchgrass had been established for at least years
and was not regularly fertilized or harvested werling et al 
we characterized the microbial community using three culture 
independent molecular methods pyrosequencing targeting the
ribosomal genes of archaea bacteria fungi and lower eukaryotes
to analyze microbial community composition and structure 
pyrosequencing targeting the nitrogen reductase nifh gene to
specifically analyze the composition of nitrogen fixing bacteria 
and microbial cell membrane lipid profiling to characterize
the living biomass of key functional groups jesus et al we
used cell wall amino sugars to quantify microbial residues in the
intensive sites these residues reflect time integrated turnover of
non living microbial necromass which plays a critical role in long 
term soil carbon and nitrogen cycles guggenberger et al 
liang et al this collection of methods enables us to
analyzemicrobial community dynamics frommultiple perspectives
with a range of taxonomic and temporal resolutions 

our aims in this study were to identify which microbial
community metrics reflected rhizosphere influence determine
whether rhizosphere influence differed between regions or site
types describe rhizosphere effects on specific taxa and func 
tional groups and measure the impact of the rhizosphere on
microbial necromass abundance this knowledge will improve our
understanding of the factors that regulate soil microbial commu 
nities in switchgrass systems and how consistently these effects
can be extrapolated 

 materials and methods

 site description and sampling

intensive sites were located at the kellogg biological research
station mi and the arlington agricultural research station wi 
where they are planted as part of a replicated bioenergy cropping
systems trial consisting of ca m plots with fully 
randomized blocks of which were sampled years after estab 
lishment for this study jesus et al we used a network of
extensive sites in both regions mi and wi where switchgrass had
been established at least years prior to sampling andwhich were
selected to capture the range of soil conditions found in their
respective region werling et al jesus et al for this
study we randomly selected mi sites and wi sites from this
network supplemental fig 

for each sampled site we arbitrarily selected healthy
switchgrass individuals from which we obtained bulk soil and
rhizosphere samples by compositing the individuals within a site 
bulk soil samples were taken from proximate bare groundwith a 
cm diameter soil corer to a depth of cm the rhizosphere was
functionally defined as the soil tightly adhering to roots after mild

 discussion

 biomass of amf and gm� bacteria increased in the rhizosphere

we observed large and consistent rhizosphere effects on mi 
crobial lipid profiles largely from increased biomass of lipid
markers for amf and gm� bacteria these organisms exhibit
greater incorporation of plant carbon than other taxa butler et al 
 although this effect may be lessened by nitrogen fertilization
 denef et al biomass of amf and gm� bacteria increases in
the bulk soil when rhizospheres are introduced e g in potted plant
experiments steer and harris and in field agricultural sys 
tems liang et al a or expanded as occurs when perennial
grasses are established in previously agricultural soils herzberger
et al leading us to expect that overall soil microbial com 
munity of a sitewould reflect the duration of influence by perennial
grass rhizospheres this expectationwas realized for gm� bacteria 
which were more abundant in the extensive sites with their longer
histories of switchgrass establishment but not for amf whichwere
substantially more abundant at the wi intensive site there is some
indication that in prairie derived soils amf biomass increases
rapidly in the years following establishment of perennial prairie
species but then decreases as the ecosystem continues to develop
 allison et al suggesting thewi intensive site could become
similar to the wi extensive sites over time even as overall amf
levels decline with site maturity our findings indicate the rhizo 
sphere continues to support greater amf biomass than the sur 
rounding bulk soils 
 microbial necromass decreased in the rhizosphere

microbial residues play an important role in long term soil
carbon and nitrogen storage simpson et al liang and balser 
 in earlier workwe found that across sites amino sugars were
correlated to soil parameters such as soil carbon and clay contents 
and minimally related to membrane lipids liang et al 
within a site however the rhizosphere exhibits a substantial
depletion of amino sugars alongside the increase in lipid biomass 
similar to but larger than results reported by appuhn et al

cycling increasing mobilization of critical nutrients such as nitro 
gen from soil organic matter hamilton and frank amino
sugars are likely being mobilized and consumed as part of this
process which is not the case in the bulk soil it is unclear whether
this dynamic would change with system maturity or management
intensity as we only had amino sugars from the intensive sites 
nonetheless it would be enlightening to further study the relative
importance of amino sugars to plant nitrogen nutrition as well as
whether rhizosphere enhanced turnover differs betweenmicrobial
residues and other soil organic matter

nifh profiles there are multiple possible explanations including
the level of taxonomic resolution for each method the actual
community property measured and the responsiveness of the
underlying biomarkers to environmental change 

lipid biomarkers can only distinguish very coarse groupings 
typically above the phylum level while ssu rrna amplicon
sequencing with universal primers can potentially identify micro 
organisms to the genus to species level kirk et al thus the
lipid data may reflect a rhizosphere benefit to gm� bacteria in
general while rrna could show variability inwhich taxawithin that
group benefit the most 

ssu rrna based methods approximate relative counts of in 
dividuals with some complications from rrn copy number vari 
ability klappenbach et al while lipid extraction estimates
the absolute mass of different taxa compared to bacteria fungal
biomass per rrn copy number is quite high potentially explaining
the disparity we observed in the representation of fungi in the lipid
and ssu rrna data fungi also exhibit protoplasmic streaming in
which active protoplasm is moved in the hyphae klein and
paschke often under stress which could affect sampling of
its dna and assessment of where activity resides moreover much
of the soil microbial population is dormant at any given time
 lennon and jones dna based profiles would be dominated
by dormant individuals while lipid profiling in principle primarily
reflects active biomass 

the way lipid and dna based assessments reflect dormancy
may underlie the difference in their assessment how responsive
microbial communities are to their environment lipid profiles
exhibit clear seasonal differences in some environments where s
rrna profiles do not jangid et al similarly ritz et al 
 found microbial lipids were associated with vegetation
composition and spatially structured at m range in an upland
grassland while s rrna profiles showed no relationship to
vegetation and were only spatially structured below the cm scale 
as seen in our results lipid profiling characterize short term
changes in complex microbial communities that are not visible to
dna based methods 

the lack of rhizosphere effects we observed in rrna profiles
may be partially due to rhizosphere dynamics in established
perennial grasslands these systems have very large root masses
which turnover rapidly gill and jackson much of the “bulk”
soil in such a system was likely recently part of this large and
fluctuating rhizosphere over time this could increase numbers of
rhizosphere organisms throughout the soil in areas outside of the
rhizosphere at the time of sampling many of these organisms
would likely be dormant lennon and jones thus having
reduced influence on the taxonomic composition of biomass but
maintaining comparable numbers of individuals in contrast 
studies finding strong rhizosphere effects have typically been
conducted in annual cropping systems costa et al peiffer
et al or recently established perennial systems singh
et al deangelis et al where much of the bulk soil
is unlikely to have recently experienced rhizosphere influence 

in addition our use of multiple sites with distinct environ 
mental properties may have precluded identification of a uniform

rhizosphere effect on microbial community taxonomic composi 
tion soil is the primary reservoir for rhizosphere biodiversity berg
and smalla rhizosphere bacterial and archaeal communities
are shaped by their associated bulk soil communities bakker et al 
 moreover the extent and even direction of rhizosphere
selection varies among soil types garbeva et al singh et al 
 schreiter et al we did not observe significant changes
in rhizosphere effects between our two regions or site types the
variability among all of our sites which were selected to reflect the
range of soil types within the two regions jesus et al and
which had different establishment ages andmanagement histories 
likely overwhelmed the more subtle locale specific effect 

it should be noted that our rrna dataset profiles the entire
microbial community due to our use of universal s s primers 
in contrast to the exclusive focus most other studies place on bac 
teria archaea despite our use of universal primers our rrna
dataset is dominated by bacteria and thus largely reflects the dy 
namics of the same taxa that are typically observed in studies like
ours prior studies have reported soil type strongly influences
rhizosphere effects on microbial community composition garbeva
et al berg and smalla in contrast to those findings 
we did not observe significantly stronger or weaker rhizosphere
effects between the two regions we studied which have distinct
soil types or the site types therein while there was a single
intensive site per state there were multiple extensive sites in each
state all with different times of establishment for their switchgrass
stands and deliberately chosen to represent different soil types of
the two regions jesus et al rhizosphere effects may have
been overwhelmed by the variance among these sites due to dif 
ferences in land use history and soil type steenwerth et al 
garbeva et al the factors that limited detection of consis 
tent rhizosphere effects on the taxonomic distribution of the soil
microbial community likely also contributed to the limited influ 
ence of the rhizosphere on the distribution of nifh genes addi 
tionally communities of n fixers associated with switchgrass are
very diverse bahulikar et al and nifh frequency is quite low
in the rhizosphere metagenome of switchgrass of the popu 
lation wang et al suggesting that the rhizosphere may not
be an overly selective environment this potentially weak selection
may have been overwhelmed by the differences among sites in
particular our two intensive sites had historically been used for
agronomic trials some involving legumes so the legacy of these
trials likely accounts for the systematic difference kulmatiski and
beard between these sites and the extensive sites 

 conclusions

we found that the impact of switchgrass rhizospheres is more
easily discerned from microbial biomass and necromass than from
the genetic makeup of the associated soil microbial community 
our findings highlight how dna and biomass based methods
characterize microbial communities differently as well as the
benefits of combining both approaches rhizosphere effects did not
differ significantly between regions or site types suggesting plant
roots may exert a relatively systematic influence on microbial
community composition biomass and residues the coupled in 
crease of microbial biomass and decrease of amino sugar abun 
dances in rhizosphere soils suggests switchgrass promotes a larger
microbial population with faster nutrient cycling potentially
improving plant access to nitrogen and other nutrients
