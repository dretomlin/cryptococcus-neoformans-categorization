abstract
sequencing environmental dna edna is increasingly being used as an alternative to
traditional morphological based identification to characterize biological assemblages
and monitor anthropogenic impacts in marine environments most studies only assess
edna which compared to erna can persist longer in the environment after cell
death therefore erna may provide a more immediate census of the environment
due to its relatively weaker stability leading some researchers to advocate for the use of
erna as an additional or perhaps superior proxy for portraying ecological changes a
variety of pre treatment techniques for screening edna and erna derived operational
taxonomic units otus have been employed prior to statistical analyses including
removing singleton taxa i e otus found only once and discarding those not present
in both edna and erna datasets in this study we used bacterial s ribosomal
rna gene and eukaryotic s ribosomal rna gene edna and erna derived data
from benthic communities collected at increasing distances along a transect from an
oil production platform taranaki new zealand macro infauna visual classification
of benthic invertebrates and physico chemical data were analyzed in parallel we
tested the effect of removing singleton taxa and removing taxa not present in the
edna and erna libraries from the same environmental sample trimmed by shared
otus by comparing the impact of the oil production platform on alpha and beta 
diversity of the edna erna based biological assemblages and by correlating these to
the morphologically identified macro faunal communities and the physico chemical
data when trimmed by singletons presence absence information from erna data
represented the best proxy to detect changes on species diversity for both bacteria and
eukaryotes however assessment of quantitative beta diversity from read abundance
information of bacteria ernadid not contrary to edna reveal any impact from the oil
production activity overall the data appeared more robust when trimmed by shared
otus showing a greater effect of the platform on alpha and beta diversity trimming
by shared otus likely removes taxa derived from legacy dna and technical artefacts

introduction
environmental dna edna metabarcoding defined here as the combined use of
universal dna barcodes and high throughput sequencing hts to characterize biological
communities from genetic material collected from environmental samples sediment 
water etc is increasingly being used to assess biodiversity and anthropogenic impacts
in terrestrial e g yu et al taberlet et al ji et al beng et al and
aquatic environments e g carew et al chariton et al visco et al 
dowle et al pochon et al pawlowski et al a pawlowski et al b 
abad et al lanzén et al metabarcoding is a cost effective method that can
rapidly and simultaneously target multiple species to complement traditional ecosystem
biomonitoring approaches valentini pompanon taberlet bourlat et al ji et
al bohmann et al it also allows microbiota that are difficult or impossible
to identify morphologically to be characterized micro organisms are at the bottom of the
food chain have shorter life cycles and often have a higher diversity and abundance than
macro fauna they may therefore be a better proxy for evaluating environmental impacts 
and their use has been advocated for biomonitoring bourlat et al pawlowski et
al pawlowski et al b pawlowski lejzerowicz esling lejzerowicz et al 
 dowle et al lau et al 

most metabarcoding monitoring studies use edna to characterize biological
communities a limited number have also evaluated data from co extracted erna
products e g pawlowski et al pawlowski et al a visco et al dowle et
al pochon et al laroche et al because rna deteriorates rapidly after
cell death erna likely provides a more accurate representation of viable communities
 mengoni et al blazewicz et al suggested that the relative concentration
of rna in the environment provides a robust indication of the growth and adaptation
potential of microbial communities in general when environmental metabarcoding
studies have used both edna and erna they have found slightly stronger correlations
between community data generated from erna and environmental conditions pawlowski
et al pawlowski et al a visco et al dowle et al pochon et al 
laroche et al however working with erna adds additional complexities and
expenses related to sampling and laboratory analysis including extra precaution during
sampling transport and storage to avoid degradation a greater understanding of the

potential benefits of using edna versus erna is therefore desirable prior to incorporating
metabarcoding methods into environmental monitoring programs 

previous studies assessing edna and erna extracted from the same environmental
sample have noted differing diversities of operational taxonomic units otus recovered
from assessment of either molecule greater taxon richness derived from edna data can be
explained through the detection of dna from dead organisms as well as extracellular dna
 free floating or legacydna that has bound to sediment or other particles however many
studies report an important number of taxa only detected from erna e g pawlowski et
al pawlowski et al a pochon et al laroche et al hu et al 
these otus may be the result of pcr sequencing artefacts or the detection of rare but
very active taxa to date most studies have dealt with this by only retaining the data of
taxa present in both edna erna datasets across the entire sample set pawlowski et al 
 pawlowski et al a dowle et al pochon et al laroche et al or
within the same sites hu et al 

a further data treatment technique which is commonly applied to datasets is the use of
minimal dna sequence read abundance thresholds for each unique taxon i e data related
to any particular otu is discarded if insufficient numbers of that taxon are detected in
the overall dataset typically – reads this is generally done to reduce sequencing
artefacts hunt et al charvet vincent lovejoy visco et al the
methods applied to the pre treatment of metabarcoding data i e use of a minimum
abundance removal threshold or dataset trimming based on shared taxa abundances can
have important implications on the final resolution number of available dna sequence
reads and or taxa sensitivity smallest perceptible effect and accuracy confidence level 
of the data used to assess anthropogenic impacts 

the aims of this study was to compare the use of co extracted edna and erna products
to assess the benthic environment around an offshore oil production platform and to
determine whether edna or erna derived taxa provide more accurate data for assessing
shifts in bacterial and micro meio eukaryotic communities we also evaluated the effects
of two different trimming methodologies one using a minimum read abundance threshold
per taxon i e ‘trimmed by singletons’ and one removing all taxa not simultaneously
recovered from both edna and erna products of the same environmental sample
 i e ‘trimmed by shared otus’ we hypothesized that bacterial and eukaryotic
datasets with taxa trimmed by shared edna and erna products would yield more
significant community shifts in response to the effect of the production platform from
the removal of most irrelevant otus and that the use of erna derived bacterial
and eukaryotic taxa would show stronger correlations with environmental variables
and macro faunal communities than edna derived taxa as it mostly depicts the living
community

bioinformatics analysis
using vsearch rognes et al raw fastq reads were truncated from the first base
where the q score dropped below and paired end assembled with a minimum merge
length of reads merged reads with more than one base pair error were discarded and
the remaining demultiplexed the bacteria and eukaryote data were concatenated into one
file each bacteria fasta eukaryote fasta and dereplicated unique sequences of bacterial
 s rrna were compared to the ribosomal database project rdp cole et al 
and unique sequences of eukaryotic s rrna mapped against the protist ribosomal 
database pr guillou et al for chimera detection prior to clustering reads into
operational taxonomic units otus with a similarity representative sequences were
sorted by abundance so that the most important sequences would be at the start of the

to record reference sequences matching a minimum of of each query entry otu 
and assign the most specific taxonomic label according to a minimum consensus fraction
 by default of the matches this approach enabled taxonomic assignment of poorly
represented taxa in reference databases operational taxonomic units with no match were
discarded 

rarefaction curves were generated in qiime using the chao and shannon metrics
 fig s this analysis demonstrated that approximately reads per sample for both
bacteria and eukaryote datasets were required to adequately capture the diversity within
each sample samples with reads one for bacterial edna and one for eukaryote
edna and erna samples were discarded from subsequent analyses table s to enable
robust comparisons between edna and erna datasets an equivalent number of samples
were kept per station for each type of molecule resulting in the additional removal of one
bacterial erna sample table s 

for the remaining data manipulation and analysis three datasets were used for both
bacteria and eukaryotes containing all otus referred to as ‘untrimmed’ only
containing otus with at least two unique sequence reads present within the whole dataset
 referred to as ‘trimmed by singletons’ and including only the otus found in both
dna and rna compartments from each sample referred to as ‘trimmed by shared
otus’ 

data analysis and statistics
samples were grouped into near field ≤ m of the fpso and far field m 
stations from each side of the fpso to visualize the effect of trimming by singletons and
by shared otus the number of reads and otus in each dataset were compared the
otus removed from the shared otus trimming method were further investigated by
displaying bar plots of the relative abundance of the ten most important classes for bacteria
and phyla for eukaryotes using the r package ‘phyloseq’ mcmurdie holmes and
by performing a mann–whitney u test with permutations on these taxa to detect
significant abundance differences between the near and far field stations 

prior to further analysis read counts were normalized among samples the large
discrepancy in read abundance among samples up to five times prevented the use of
typical normalization techniques such as variance stabilization r package deseq love 
huber anders or cumulative sum scaling r package metagenomeseq paulson
et al and a subsampling based normalization strategy was employed following
the method described in aguirre de carcer et al briefly multiple rarefactions 
times based on the median number of reads among all samples were performed followed
by a rarefaction to the lowest number of reads among all samples since a large number of
singletons may represent pcr or sequencing artefacts majaneva et al brown et al 
 these were removed prior to statistical analysis 

using normalized data kept after the two different trimming techniques observed
otus and the shannon diversity index were analyzed for each sample to test for the
effect of the fpso on the bacterial and eukaryotic alpha diversity of edna erna datasets

a nonparametric t test using permutations was performed between near and far 
field stations to determine whether the edna or erna dataset contained the most
abundant number of otus significantly affected by the fpso activity a non parametric
t test with permutations was conducted on otus present in at least three samples 
between the near and far field station groups differences in beta diversity between and
within the near and far field stations were tested using an adonis and permdisp tests
with permutations on bray curtis distance matrices using square root transformed
data non metric multidimensional scaling plots were obtained using the r package
‘phyloseq’ mcmurdie holmes correlations between bacterial and eukaryotic
edna erna otus and macro fauna beta diversities and with environmental variables
were investigated using a mantel test based on permutations the tests were performed
on square root transformed data using bray curtis distance matrices for biological data 
and an euclidean distance matrix for environmental data for the later only variables
showing a significant change between the near field and far field stations were used i e 
barium and afdw johnston elvines newton and square root transformed prior
to the distance matrix computation except for the bar plots and nmds all analyses
mentioned above were computed using the qiime pipeline caporaso et al 

results
high throughput sequencing output
each of the sediment samples collected in this study were co extracted for both edna
and erna and pcr amplified for total bacteria and eukaryotes resulting in the total
production of pcr amplicons for bacteria and for eukaryotes table s the
no template pcr controls remained negative in all pcr trials all amplicons were
sequenced on an illuminatm miseq instrument yielding a total of and 
edna and erna sequence reads respectively the water blank negative controls ddh o
sample contained a total of raw reads for bacteria and for eukaryotes in the
edna library and raw reads for bacteria and for eukaryotes in the erna
library of which none remained after quality filtering the positive controls were assigned
at to the three target taxa after removal of unmatched and low quality reads a
total of reads and otus were obtained for bacteria edna erna 
 and a total of reads and otus edna erna for
eukaryotes removal of samples with insufficient diversity coverage led to the removal of
one bacterial edna and erna sample fe b and one eukaryotic edna fe b and
erna fe c sample table s 

effect of trimming methodologies
for the bacterial dataset the removal of singletons i e otus present only once across
the entire edna erna datasets resulted in a loss of total reads and loss of otus
 table similar results were observed for eukaryotes where of reads and of
otus were removed trimming otus that did not occur in both edna erna amplicons
of the same sample resulted in a total reduction in otus of and total read reduction of
 for eukaryote data trimming by shared otus had a larger impact on otu and read

macro fauna and environmental variables table for eukaryotes however this tendency
was not always observed as erna showed slightly stronger correlations andmore significant
results between the near and far field stations but weaker correlations with macro faunal

erna beta diversities were stronger for the trimmed by shared otus datasets and only
significantly positive among the eukaryote datasets table for bacteria the trimmed by
singletons datasets demonstrated particularly weak correspondence r − p value 
 between edna and erna 

discussion
the aims of this study were to assess whether high throughput sequencing hts data
obtained from edna and or erna provide the best proxy for evaluating environmental
impacts and to explore how data processing steps may influence these results we focused
on benthic habitats at bathysmal depth within close proximity to an offshore oil production
platform 

high throughput sequencing outputs
in our datasets the number of bacterial edna otus table was slightly higher than
erna environmental dna is more resistant to posthumous degradation and may persist
several years in marine sediment dell’anno analysis of the eukaryote data showed
a differing pattern with more erna otus compared to edna the proportion of otus
found only in edna or erna datasets varies substantially among previous investigations 
for example dowle et al found more bacterial erna than edna otus in their
datasets and hu et al and laroche et al obtained more protist erna than
edna otus while pawlowski et al and pochon et al detected more protist

laroche et al peerj doi peerj

edna than erna otus it is possible that many of the unshared erna otus represent
pcr artefacts especially from the reverse transcription of rna to cdna and sequencing
errors egge et al ficetola et al the rna conversion to complementary dna
 cdna requires the use of a reverse transcriptase which as opposed to dna polymerase 
lack proof reading activity creating point mutations in some of the cdna sequences
 svarovskaia et al houseley tollervey reverse transcriptase also frequently
‘jump’ from one template to another during the transcription process known as template 
switching this action can lead to two different outcomes production of chimeric cdna
sequences from intermolecular template switching and creation of shortened isoform
sequences from intramolecular template switching cocquet et al the latter being
more problematic as it is unlikely to be detected during bioinformatics analysis finally 
the use of random hexamer primers for cdna synthesis is known to introduce nucleotide
bias at the beginning of the ′ end of sequence reads hansen brenner dudoit 
because the pre mentioned artefacts are subsequently augmented by the gene specific pcr
amplification they would become integrated into the hts library and potentially not
be removed during bioinformatics filtering processes the incertitude linked to potential
intrinsic error rates from reverse transcription limits accurate comparison of edna and
erna datasets the use of a rna control e g synthetic oligomers and technical pcr 
replicates could help identifying these artefacts and improve concordance between the
edna and erna profiles trimming otus by their shared presence in edna and erna
represents an alternative way of discarding reverse transcription artefacts 

in this study bacterial and eukaryote rnas were treated using the same protocol during
the reverse transcription process however eukaryote cdna required more pcr cycles 
instead of for bacteria to amplify sufficient material potentially producing more false
transcripts and explaining the differences observed between the two taxonomic groups
 fig another possibility could be the presence of rare but highly active eukaryote otus
which were not detected in the edna dataset because of their low abundance particularly
high activity and growth from some of the rare biota has been previously reported for
both bacteria campbell et al hugoni et al and microbial eukaryotes logares
et al 

effect of trimming methodologies
trimming otus not simultaneously present in both edna and erna assemblages from
the same samples resulted in twice as many otus being removed compared to discarding
singletons only and removed fold bacteria and fold eukaryotes more reads 
however further investigation suggested that it mostly resulted in the removal of legacy
dna dna deposited from the water column and technical artefacts this improved the
sensitivity and accuracy of our environmental metabarcoding analysis tables and 
and enabled the detection of differences between the effects of the production platform on
near and far field stations in particular it allowed us to disclose the divergence between
beta diversities of near field and far field stations and improved the correlations between
the beta diversity and environmental variables distance matrices table

removal of single sequence detection singletons to reduce pcr and sequencing
artefacts is a controversial practice although many of these detections are true errors
 parada needham fuhrman some may constitute real otu occurrences in
studies not particularly interested by the rare biota the trade off of producing false
negatives to remove false positives is usually accepted majaneva et al bálint et
al systematic inclusion or exclusion of singletons is arbitrary and not necessarily
adapted to all situations for example the likelihood of retaining false positives increases
with the sequencing depth of hts libraries ficetola taberlet coissac some
researchers have therefore suggested the use of a read detection threshold based on
sequencing depth bálint et al however ficetola taberlet coissac and
lahoz monfort guillera arroita tingley strongly discouraged systematic removal
of taxa based on an abundance threshold unless high detection probability of realotus and
sufficient biological or technical replicates are available to identify false positives instead 
they propose the application of site occupancy detection modelling sodm methods
which take into account false positive and negative detection probabilities and which
have proven to work well with few replicate samples schmidt et al lahoz monfort 
guillera arroita tingley 

in our study we used co extracted dna and rna to segregate real otus from artefacts 
this approach allows for an informed elimination of artefactual otus while also discarding
data from legacy dna however trimming data by shared otus between co extracted
edna and erna material is particularly stringent and may result in the removal of a
substantial number of false negatives as an alternative biological or technical replicates
could be used in parallel to discriminate genuine and false detections for example 
biological replicates could be pooled together prior to trimming by shared otus and
subsequently demultiplexed to allow evaluation of within station variability it is worth
mentioning that the application of unsupervised oligotyping methodologies such as the
one proposed by eren et al could further improve sensitivity of environmental
metabarcoding monitoring studies by discriminating closely related taxa and will likely
gain in popularity as tools are being developed 

operational taxonomic units not shared between both
edna and erna datasets
among the bacterial datasets most of the removed otus i e those not simultaneously
found in both edna and erna belonged to gammaproteobacteria anddeltaproteobacte 
ria which also constituted the main classes of the singleton trimmed dataset this suggests
that most otus removed by the shared otus trimming method may have arisen from
pcr or sequencing errors originating from highly abundant unique sequences which
subsequently associated to these classes huse et al quince et al another
possibility could be that these abundant taxa have more polymorphisms in such cases 
removal of these rare variants would produce false negatives nonetheless their small
contribution to weighted abundance based analyses as demonstrated in the present
study would unlikely affect results 

laroche et al peerj doi peerj

http dx doi org peerj 


most of the eukaryotes which were removed during the trimming procedure were
metazoa dinophyta and apicomplexa in edna and ciliophora and cercozoa in erna
 fig table s these phyla are also the most abundant in the datasets trimmed by
singletons table s none of these showed a significant correlation with distance from
the platform table s just as for bacteria the important abundance of these phyla in the
discarded edna ernaotus is likely a consequence of pcr sequencing errors originating
from the most abundant unique sequences this is further supported by the fact that the
decreasing order of relative abundance of the most important taxa is the same between the
datasets of kept otus and removed otus resulting from the shared otus trimming 

comparison between edna and erna
when performing alpha diversity on the trimmed by singletons datasets differences were
observed between edna and erna with the latter mainly showing stronger dissimilarities
between the near field and far field stations this is not surprising as edna can contain
genetic information of past and current communities inflating alpha diversity and
potentially masking the present effects of the platform corinaldesi danovaro dell’anno 
 dell’anno 

beta diversity analysis of the singleton trimmed data showedmore significant differences
between the near and far field stations with bacterial edna while only small differences
could be observed between eukaryote edna and erna relationships between micro 
eukaryotic and the macro faunal assemblages and environmental variables were also much
stronger than with edna this suggest that while erna may represent a better proxy for
assessing ongoing anthropogenic effects on species diversity edna seems more reliable for
assessing effects on community composition this is especially true for bacteria where no
correlation could be observed between erna data andmacro fauna or with environmental
variables table these results contrast with other similar studies pawlowski et al 
visco et al dowle et al pochon et al laroche et al hu et al 
where erna always out performed edna when correlating microbial and macro faunal
assemblages or when correlating these assemblages with environmental conditions 
nonetheless these studies used a less stringent otu filtering method prior to statistical
analyses removing only those not present in both edna erna compartment of their
whole dataset consequently an important number of otus from legacy dna may
have subsisted in their datasets decreasing the observed sensitivity to local conditions of
the edna derived communities also the relationship between erna concentrations and
activity does not always align differences such as life history life strategies and non growth
activity between organisms play an important role in rna production blazewicz et al 
 ribosomal erna such as those targeted in this study s and s can have a much
wider range of expression over orders of magnitude than ribosomal edna ca order
of magnitude fegatella et al fluctuation in dna copy number between taxa and
in rna expression may account for the strong variability observed among the bacterial
edna and erna replicates table s this variability increases confidence intervals 
reduces statistical power and increases the risk of not identifying impacts type ii errors

for accurate assessment of false positive and negative otu occurrences and sufficient
evaluation of within station biological variability optimal number of replicate samples is
often a compromise between available funds and time and the desired level of precision and
sensitivity parameters such as targeted taxa the choice of primer set and the sequencing
depth of hts libraries all play an important part in taxa detection probability which
in turn dictates the optimal replication level ficetola et al in studies assessing
whole communities the number of replicates should ideally depend on the taxa with the
lowest detection probability ficetola et al give an example where a taxon with a 
probability would normally require a minimum of eight replicates to ensure detection for
routine monitoring surveys of benthic communities however where the non detection of
rare biota is unlikely to change the outcomes of studies the replication level does not have
to be as high in such cases the number of replicates may be more influenced by the level
of heterogeneity found within stations 

an important consideration when using single time sampling designs over a
contamination gradient is that it assumes that natural factors equally influence communities
among samples wiens parker this bias can be particularly problematic with
small and short lived organisms like bacteria in low impacted environments such as those
explored in this study biological interactions may supplant the effect of environmental
factors increasing spatial variability schafer and creating stronger discrepancies
among biological replicates in this situation collecting more biological replicates per
stations should be favoured over technical replicates in order to mitigate the effect of
micro patchiness 

conclusion
the resolution sensitivity and accuracy of metabarcoding techniques used to measure
anthropogenic impact on microbial communities can be substantially affected by whether
edna or erna is used and by the choice of pre analysis data treatmentmethod disparities
in results may also occur between eukaryote and bacterial edna erna that should be
considered before analyzing environmental metabarcoding monitoring data our study
showed that when otus are solely trimmed by singletons erna represents a better
proxy for alpha diversity as it is more likely to contain living biota only nonetheless read
abundance information from edna data was for bacteria superior to its counterpart
for assessing environmental impacts on beta diversity in weakly impacted environments 
this may be even more important as erna concentration can be highly dependent and
sensitive to temporal interactions from restricted local conditions that can be unrelated
to the anthropogenic activity for this reason read abundance information from bacterial
edna seems more suited for assessing the effect of oil and gas drilling and production
operations where closest monitored stations are located far from the pollution source ca 
 m overall trimming otus not shared in both dna and rna compartments of
each sample improved the sensitivity and accuracy of our results while this is true for our
study site further investigations will be needed to evaluate the extent of these findings
