abstract in france about ha per year of arable

land become unsuitable for food production due to erosion 

acidification sealing and pollution by metallic and organic

compounds bioenergy crops such as miscanthus x gigan 

teus are used to rehabilitate polluted soils for crop produc 

tion although the economic potential of this crop is known 

the crop abilities to regenerate the soil biological properties

enabling sustainable crop production still remain unclear 

here we evaluated the effects of the miscanthus crop on the

abundance and diversity of soil bacterial and fungal com 

munities in a wastewater contaminated soil using syn 

chronic and diachronic evaluation strategies a year field

experiment near paris was set up on an agricultural field

irrigated with raw wastewater for more than years thus

inducing a strong metal and organic contamination of the

soil we characterized the abundance and diversity of soil

microbial communities using metagenomic techniques our

results show that the miscanthus crop had an early effect on

microbial communities by stimulating bacterial diversity 

by about and fungal diversity by about this

positive effect could be explained by the release of fresh

organic matter from litter decomposition and root exuda 

tion and by the absence of tillage and pesticide spraying 

which are known to degrade soil microflora on the other

hand no significant effect on microbial biomass has been

recorded overall our findings show that miscanthus crop 

ping is a promising practice to enhance the regeneration of

soil microbiological diversity and to reclame polluted soils

introduction

to date most of the agricultural soils in france were used

under intensive farming requiring consistent soil tillage and

chemical fertilizers and pesticides inputs soil amendments

with manure sewage sludge or irrigation with urban

wastewater were also common practices between 

and of the agricultural land surface about 

million hectares was irrigated with wastewater providing

readily degradable organic compounds which are useful to

improve plant growth and crop production http www 

agreste agriculture gouv fr img pdf primeur pdf 

however such practices often result in acute and diffuse

contaminations of the soil since wastewater may contain

important amount of recalcitrant organic compounds trace

metals and antibiotics leading to a high level of accumu 

lation of toxic exogenous metallic or organic compounds in

these soils lamy et al 

high levels of exogenous trace metals can have a

detrimentally effect on the number diversity and activity

of soil organisms such as soil macrofauna nahmani and

lavelle and microorganisms kandeler et al 

ranjard et al as soil microorganisms play a crucial

role in soil quality and functioning e g in soil aggregate

structure organic matter turn over and mineralization 

community diversity modifications consecutive to metal

stress might also affect soil biological functioning and

affect some of the ecosystem services provided by soil

 bååth et al trace metals in addition to their

negative effects on soil organisms have a long residence

time in soils which become unsuitable for crop production

over several generations due to the decrease in soil fertility

and or hazards of food quality for human consumption 

recently a strategy has been developed to rehabilitate

agricultural activity on polluted soils the use of plants not

dedicated to food consumption for humans or animals but

intended for bioenergy production evangelou et al 

plant cover prevents bulk erosion and increases soil carbon

sequestration which can further limit the toxicity and

vertical transfer of metals by improving stabilization of the

metals in soils among the various energy crops the c 

grass miscanthus x giganteus named giant miscanthus 

has been recommended as a suitable biofuel crop and its

cultivation is now widespread in europe it is a perennial

crop displaying an efficient use of nitrogen and water good

disease resistance and high economic potential in addition 

it shows good growth quality on contaminated sites le 

wandowski et al several field trials have demon 

strated that planting giant miscanthus modifies soil

disturbance absence of tillage reduced use of pesticides 

and leads to the formation of new habitats through the

development of surface litter and extensive root systems 

with impacts on pollutant dynamics as well as on organ 

isms living in soil dauber et al several studies

conducted on soil fauna revealed an increase in soil

mesofauna and macrofauna abundance and diversity when

mxg bioenergy crops rather than annual wheat crops 

were grown on polluted soils chauvat et al hedde

et al by contrast the effect on microorganisms of

planting giant miscanthus in polluted soils has been poorly

investigated and it is not known if this practice has a

positive or negative impact on bacterial and fungal com 

munities such information is essential with respect to

major role of microorganisms in processes underlying soil

fertility and sustainable crop production 

the aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of

miscanthus x giganteus cropping on the indigenous

microbial communities in a long term contaminated soil 

investigations were carried out on a real field location

close to paris pierrelaye france which had been irri 

gated with raw wastewater for more than a years 

these inputs led to the accumulation of a huge amount of

recalcitrant organic matter especially in the soil surface

horizon as well as micro pollutants especially zn pb cu 

and cd trace metals van oort et al the short term

impact of miscanhtus crop on microbial communities was

assessed by a synchronic comparative study of plots

planted with giant miscanthus for years and a plot under

a conventional wheat crop system and by a diachronic

study monitoring microbial community dynamics during

 year period following the planting of giant miscanthus 

microbial communities were characterized in terms of

molecular microbial biomass dequiedt et al as well

as bacterial and fungal diversity pyrosequencing of

the s and s rrna genes directly amplified from soil

dna we hypothesized that miscanhtus crop in com 

parison with conventional cropping would stimulate more

microbial abundance and diversity in this polluted soil by

providing new soil habitats for microorganisms thus lim 

iting the influence of metal contamination and the preva 

lence of resistant populations and therefore enhancing soil

biological quality and fertility 

materials and methods

experimental site history and soil sampling design

studies were conducted on a field site close to paris within

a ha wide agricultural area at pierrelaye france 
latitude � n longitude � e the soils at this site
are sandy textured classified as orthic and albic luvisols

 iuss working group wrb for more than a

century they have been used for market gardening and

irrigated with raw wastewater from the urban paris in order

to increase the organic quality of this soil by supplying c 

n and k inputs however they also led to the accumula 

tion of recalcitrant organic matter dissolved salts car 

bonates phosphates and metallic pollutants in the surface

horizon of the soil lamy et al van oort et al 

as a consequence the spreading of raw wastewater was

finally stopped in the early s and the market gardening

was prohibited to promote cereal cropping and to introduce

bioenergy crops especially the c grass miscanthus x

giganteus the experimental site in this agricultural area

was composed of three plots fig the first p 

 m was implanted with giant miscanthus english

cultivar from novabiom� france in the second p 

 m was under an annual crop system tillage and

crop rotations of wheat sorghum triticale and maize in

 and the third p plot m was planted with

giant miscanthus in english cultivar from nov 

abiom� france 

the impact of miscanthus x giganteus perennial crop 

ping on microbial communities was assessed by a a

synchronic comparative analysis of the microbial commu 

nities in the p and p plots in and b a diachronic

study in p by monitoring the microbial communities

during a year period of giant miscanthus growth fol 

lowing its planting in all samples were taken at a

depth of – cm five replicates were collected from p 

and p in march for the synchronic study and from

p in march and for the diachronic study

purified according to terrat et al 

bacterial and fugal diversity

bacterial diversity was estimated by pyrosequencing

of the s rrnav v gene region as described by terrat

et al the gene fragment about bp was first

amplified by using the primers f and r then a

second pcr was run on purified pcr products from the

first pcr using ten based pair multiplex identifiers mid

was then carried out on a gs junior roche 

sequencing system 

bioinformatics analysis

a bioinformatics analysis was done using the gns pipe of

the genosol platform as described by terrat et al 

first all the s and s raw reads were sorted according

to the multiplex identifier sequences the raw reads were

then filtered and deleted based on a their length b their

number of ambiguities ns c and their primer s se 

quence s a perl program was then applied for rigorous

dereplication i e clustering of strictly identical sequen 

ces the dereplicated reads were then aligned using

infernal alignment and clustered into operational taxo 

nomic units otu using a perl program that groups rare

reads to abundant ones and does not count differences in

homopolymer lengths a filtering step was then carried out

to check all single singletons reads detected only once and

not clustered which might be artifacts such as pcr chi 

meras based on the quality of their taxonomic assign 

ments finally in order to compare the datasets efficiently

and avoid biased community comparisons the retained

reads were homogenized by random selection closed to the

lowest dataset 

the retained high quality reads for bacteria and

 for fungi were used for taxonomy independent

analyses to determine diversity and richness indices using

the defined otu composition at similarity the raw

results and discussion

on the pierrelaye site irrigation with wastewater was ini 

tially intended to increase the fertility of the sandy textured

soils used for market gardening but also led to an homo 

geneous and important accumulation of recalcitrant organic

matter high c n ratio between and and metal ele 

ments which was previously described by lamy et al 

 table in this context we have conducted syn 

chronic and diachronic studies to evaluate the effect of

miscanthus crop on soil microbiological community in

terms of abundance diversity and structure for a subse 

quent agricultural restoration 

influence of wastewater irrigation on agronomical

and microbiological soil characteristics

in all plots of the studied site it is important to note that the

level of microbial biomass from lg dna g soil to
 lg dna g soil and diversity from to 
bacterial taxons and from to fungal ones was high

 figs and did not reflect neither the sandy texture of

the soil dequiedt et al terrat et al nor the

impact of the metal pollution acknowledged to decrease

these microbial parameters kuperman and carreiro 

these results might be explained by the large amount of

soil organic carbon accumulated by irrigation with raw

wastewater for one century that limits metal toxicity iqbal

et al and stimulates microbial abundance and

diversity hidri et al however the high c n ratio

recorded for the soil organic matter in these soils from 

to does not fit these findings since it indicates a strong

stabilization of the soil organic matter the large c n ratio

may point to an unusual urban nature of the organic matter t

spread by irrigation and or the deleterious effect of metal

elements on organic matter turnover lamy et al 

response of microbial community to miscanthus

crop

the short term synchronic comparison of microbial abun 

dance and diversity in plot soil under mxg for years p 

and plot soil under a conventional crop system with maize

 p was conducted in fig no significant dif 

ference was observed for molecular microbial biomass or

for bacterial diversity in terms of richness and evenness

 figs these results could reflect the impact of trace

metal pollution history as being the main factor structuring

the soil microbial community and homogenizing the

microbial parameters between plots in addition the

recalcitrance of organic matter with a high c n ratio about

 would explain the poor availability of nutrient

resources for bacteria leading to a low reactivity and high

stability of this community to surrounding changing con 

ditions rousk and bååth on the other hand the

absence of bacterial discrimination might also be partly due

to the relatively short period of mxg cultivation on this site

 from to since this crop is known to require

more than years to become fully established 

as regards fungal s rrna gene sequencing fungal

diversity was significantly higher under the miscanthus

crop due to an increase in richness about taxons for p 

against for p fig whereas fungal evenness was

similar in both cropping systems increases in fungal

richness can be partly due to the halting of certain agri 

cultural practices such as tillage and some use of antifungal

pesticide products in the p plot soil tillage leads to the

physical breakdown of fungal mycelium and of their

macroaggregates habitats resulting in deleterious effects on

the abundance and diversity of soil fungi lienhard et al 

 however our observation can also highlight the

beneficial effect of miscanthus cropping since perennial

cover plants provide a stable environment and habitats 

with fresh organic matter input due to the release of root

exudates and the accumulation of litter plant residue litter

on the soil surface chauvat et al the greater

stimulation of fungi as compared to bacteria might result

from their role in litter decomposition their ability to

produce a wide range of extracellular enzymes enabling

them to use the recalcitrant organic matter such as ligno 

cellulose or other plant polymers this ability was partic 

ularly relevant on our site where the soil organic matter

was rather recalcitrant c n ratio about this syn 

chronic study revealed therefore a significant higher

stimulation of microbial diversity by miscanthus cropping

compared to conventional annual wheat crop 

dynamics of soil microbial communities

during the implantation of miscanthus crop

to complement the synchronic comparison diachronic

monitoring was carried out in the p plot planted with

giant miscanthus from to fig during this

period the molecular microbial abundance did not vary

significantly about lg dna g soil in com 
pared with lg dna g soil in fig 
according with the synchronic study the bacterial richness

and evenness parameters remained similar year after

mxg planting but showed a significant increase during the

second year from to fig e g from 

taxons in to in these results assessed an

early beneficial effect of the miscanthus crop on bacterial

diversity stimulating richness and improving evenness 

possibly via the release of fresh litter and root exudates

containing readily available c substrates kaňová et al 

 

monitoring of the fungal community during the years

of miscanthus cropping revealed a significant increase in

fungal diversity during the first year of miscanthus

implantation which was resilient during the second year

 fig similarly the fungal evenness increased slightly

 but not significantly during this period these results

confirmed those obtained with the synchronic study and

lead to the conclusion that miscanthus crops stimulate

fungal diversity

community in a long term wastewater contaminated site

did not reveal any significant modification of molecular

microbial biomass but highlighted positive effects on

microbial communities diversity the absence of effect on

molecular microbial biomass might be partly explained by

the young stage of development of this crop from to

 years combined with the strong structuring of the

microbial community brought about by the long history of

metallic and organic pollution of the site giant miscanthus

cropping seemed to have an early effect on bacterial and

fungal diversity by stimulating richness and improving

evenness probably due to the release of fresh organic

matter through litter accumulation and root exudation in

conclusion miscanthus planting seemed to provide new

habitats and resources leading to a restoration of soil bio 

logical patrimony and potentially functioning via an

improvement of microbial diversity similar results were

observed on this site when soil mesofauna was targeted

 chauvat et al hedde et al our results

demonstrate that planting a perennial miscanthus bioen 

ergy crop on contaminated soils can be considered as a

good strategy to restore soil microbial diversity with the

aim to rehabilitate polluted sites for their subsequent

agricultural use
