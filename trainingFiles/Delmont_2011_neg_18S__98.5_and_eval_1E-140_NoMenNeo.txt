soil microbial communities contain the highest level of prokaryotic diversity of any environment and
metagenomic approaches involving the extraction of dna from soil can improve our access to these commu 
nities most analyses of soil biodiversity and function assume that the dna extracted represents the microbial
community in the soil but subsequent interpretations are limited by the dna recovered from the soil 
unfortunately extraction methods do not provide a uniform and unbiased subsample of metagenomic dna 
and as a consequence accurate species distributions cannot be determined moreover any bias will propagate
errors in estimations of overall microbial diversity and may exclude some microbial classes from study and
exploitation to improve metagenomic approaches investigate dna extraction biases and provide tools for
assessing the relative abundances of different groups we explored the biodiversity of the accessible community
dna by fractioning the metagenomic dna as a function of i vertical soil sampling ii density gradients cell
separation iii cell lysis stringency and iv dna fragment size distribution each fraction had a unique
genetic diversity with different predominant and rare species based on ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis
 risa fingerprinting and phylochips all fractions contributed to the number of bacterial groups uncovered
in the metagenome thus increasing the dna pool for further applications indeed we were able to access a
more genetically diverse proportion of the metagenome a gain of more than compared to the best single
extraction method limit the predominance of a few genomes and increase the species richness per sequencing
effort this work stresses the difference between extracted dna pools and the currently inaccessible complete
soil metagenome 

the soil microbial community is relatively diverse 
with arguably the highest level of prokaryotic diversity of any
environment one gram of soil has been reported to
contain up to billion microorganisms and thousands of dif 
ferent species this soil species pool represents a gold 
mine for genes involved in pharmaceutical and industrial ap 
plications and in the biodegradation of human made
pollutants currently less than of this diversity is
considered to be cultivable by traditional techniques a
problem that can be circumvented by metagenomic ap 
proaches metagenomic approaches have been applied to
study a range of soil environments and
comparisons with cultivation techniques should include biases
in the methods used to extract dna from soil different dna
extraction methods are widely used although they each have
biases that restrict the diversity of the so called metagenomic
dna therefore the total microbial
diversity of soil might still be underestimated independent of
the method used to calculate the species or operational tax 
onomic unit otu diversity in a soil indeed the relative
dominance of certain groups in dna extracted from soil will

mask less abundant species thus confounding estimates of soil
microbial community structure 

recently developed technologies provide relatively quick
and deep sequencing of metagenomic dna samples at a mod 
erate cost although metagenomic dna sequencing 
however completely sequenced depends on the dna ex 
tracted deciphering soil function based on soil metagenome
sequencing such as that proposed previously by the terrage 
nome international consortium requires extraction of
the dna from all members of the soil microbial community 
the difficulty is that every protocol facilitates the extraction of
part of the microbially diverse population to the detriment of
the rest biodiversity estimates from a variety of methods fig 
 already range from species to species 
per gram of soil therefore a measure of the dependence of
biodiversity estimates on metagenomic access would aid in an
understanding of whether sequencing depth or dna extrac 
tion diversity is driving diversity estimations 

our approach was to combine different methods to recover
different spectra of community diversity in order to increase
access to the biodiverse soil community we applied four
classes of dna or microbial separation techniques that sig 
nificantly resolve dna diversity these techniques are based
on i vertical soil sampling ii cell separation in a density
gradient iii cell lysis stringency and iv dna fragment size
distribution fig although the respective methods used are
not without some overlap we have shown that they can be
adjusted to increase the relative diversity of the final dna
pool in other words by varying the conditions of the four

tive diversity and the less represented species the final dna
pool can be optimized for increased nucleic acid diversity this
strategy was compared to other more common approaches
 including the individual application of one of the methods
used here in order to illustrate the advantages of this ap 
proach although applying these four variables might improve
the already distorted view of the relative abundance of species 
the aim here is to enhance species and gene discovery by
maximizing the identification of the genetic diversity of a dna

materials and methods

soil samples samples were collected from two sites ecully france and an
untreated control plot plot “ d” of park grass lat °n long
 °e rothamsted england see http www rothamsted ac uk for further
information in october and march respectively the park grass soil
is an internationally recognized resource and is targeted as a reference soil for
soil metagenomic studies it is classified as chromic luvisol according to
fao guidelines and is a silty clay loam overlying clay with flints with a ph
of measured in h o park grass covers m by m and the
sampling strategy consisted of taking randomized soil samples in four areas of
the plot horizontal sampling and at seven depths vertical sampling each cm
between and cm the ecully soil silty topsoil was sampled in a grassland

area lat °n long °e at the same seven depths samples were
placed into plastic bags and transported on ice soil was homogenized manually
by thorough physical mixing all tools and materials used were washed and
sterilized 

dna extraction methods dna extraction from soil is a key step in the
metagenomic approach two different methods are routinely used in
the first method direct extraction cells are lysed within the soil sample 
 we used two direct dna extraction protocols that involve bead beating a
method described previously griffiths et al that uses the fastprep lysing
matrix mp bead beating bio biomedical and the mobio ultraclean soil
dna isolation kit for both protocols dna was extracted from g of soil for
the alternative method cells were first removed from the soil g and then
lysed this method is commonly called indirect extraction and has been
reported to separate prokaryotic from eukaryotic cells via a nycodenz density
gradient during the centrifugation the nycodenz gradient is stabilized
at a density of g ml and should isolate prokaryotes to form a cellular fraction
called the cell ring fig we fractionated the gradient into six parts each ml
 four fractions above the cell ring the cell ring and one below the cell ring total
of ml by varying the centrifugation speed � g � g � g 
and � g for min after centrifugation at each speed the nycodenz
gradient was subsampled from the top down by pipetting out ml samples the
cell ring was within the fifth subsample 

after cell separation in the gradient we used different cell lysis protocols 
which have various degrees of stringency the mp bead beating protocol the
epicentre gram positive kit the nucleospin tissue kit and five agarose plug
protocols called protocols a b c d and e 

agarose plugs the extraction of soil bacteria was performed on fresh soil
samples as previously described by bertrand et al using the nycodenz

gradient separation method the collected bacterial cell fraction was washed
with ultrapure water and then centrifuged for min at � g the cell
pellet was then resuspended in a mm tris ph – mm edta buffer 
mixed with an equal volume of molten incert agarose and then transferred
into disposable plug molds bio rad the lysis of the soil bacteria was then
performed with agarose after the different lysis methods were used agarose
plugs were equilibrated in a mm tris ph – mm edta storage buffer

incubated in ml of g� lysis buffer with �g ml of proteinase k at °c

of la lysis buffer mm tris ph mm edta mg of lysozyme ml 
 mg of achromopeptidase ml and incubated at °c for h the agarose
plugs were then incubated in ml of sp lysis buffer mm tris ph

additional incubation for h was performed with fresh sp buffer

mg of achromopeptidase ml and incubated at °c for h 

these plug protocols for differential dna recovery have also been used for
fosmid library construction that requires high molecular weight dna to create
clone libraries with different sequence diversities 

dna size separation pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge was used to
separate the metagenomic dna as a function of the fragment size distribution
 low melting point agarose and � tris borate edta tbe with a pro 

gram of s s and h the dna was then extracted from the gel by using

were smaller than those in the undisrupted portion as demonstrated by the

one microliter of the pcr mix was then loaded into an agilent dna lab

 spots each on a standard glass slide format in by in mm by 
mm each spot was formed by the in situ synthesis of mer oligonucleotide
probes each oligonucleotide probe occurred at least in triplicate within each

eight samples at the same time and on the same slide the use of multiple slides
was necessary for the hybridization of over eight samples probes were designed

microarray scanning and data processing an innoscan carbonne france 
 scanner was used for scanning microarray slides according to the manufac 
turer’s instructions raw hybridization fluorescence signals for each spot were
determined based on the signal to noise ratio snr which was calculated by
using the following formula snr � signal intensity � background standard
deviation of the background hybridization fluorescence signals for all probes 
including negative controls were transformed by calculating the log of the
signal since at least three replicates exist for all oligonucleotide probes outliers
were eliminated when any individual spot was greater than standard deviations
from the average of all replicates analysis of variance anova was used to
evaluate positive probes from the results for all microarray data from one
experiment since the probes have different phylogenetic depths the genera
described here were those for which all relevant probes were positive while all
of the thousands of probes could not be independently verified many of the
probes were validated by the application of dna from a single bacterium 

results

two different soils were employed for the elaboration of the
dna recovering strategy ecully france and park grass plot
 d rothamsted england different approaches were tested
to separate and increase the metagenomic dna extracted at
one time and one place and the diversity of the different
samples was estimated with ribosomal intergenic spacer anal

peared to separate metagenomic dna into the most diverse
fractions for the two soils vertical soil sampling density gra 
dient cell separation cell lysis stringency and dna fragment
size distribution fig the different methods could be ap 
plied sequentially to maximize differential dna extraction
 fig clearly all the extracted dna pools have distinct
species diversities and distributions however the cell lysis
stringency appeared to have the most influence on the diversity
of the extracted dna pool as discussed below

order to evaluate the differences between the different risa
profiles the rothamsted profiles were quantified and the dif 
ferent samples were compared with a principal component
analysis pca the pca separated the groups principally as a
function of the cell lysis procedure fig within these large
groups other parameters are regrouped such as fractions from
different depths in the soil core the nycodenz gradient frac 
tions where “top” refers to different samples from above the
cell ring and the pfge smear where bw is about kb 
bw is about kb and bw is about kb in addition the
mp bead beating extraction method was applied to both the
soil direct cell extraction and the nycodenz cell ring while
the bead beating produced somewhat similar risa profiles 
the direct and indirect “cell ring” samples were differentiated
by the pca fig some replicates are provided in order to
evaluate the relative importance of the risa profiles for
example the mobio kit method was performed twice on the
deepest soil sample to cm deep and the bead beating
was performed three times on the second depth fraction to
 cm all of the replicates grouped relatively closely together
 fig 

taxonomic comparisons for the rothamsted soil the dif 
ference between the metagenomic dnas extracted by these
different methods was further explored with the phylogenetic
microarray in order to determine which genera were selectively
extracted by one approach or the other comparisons of the
microarray responses were therefore made between different
extraction protocols 

in addition the same dna extraction protocol mp bead
beating was used to evaluate the microbial diversity differ 
ences as a function of depth vertical soil sampling phylochip
analysis using s rrna gene rrs hybridization showed sig 
nificant diversity variations with the frequency of bacillus spp 
increasing and that of mesorhizobium species decreasing with
depth some genera were detected in only one fraction for
example sandarakinotalea was detected only at the to cm
depth alkalibacillus and ammoniphilus were detected at the
lowest depth see fig s in the supplemental material after
centrifugation at a relatively low speed � g the density
gradient was subsampled in six fractions four fractions above
the cell ring one at the cell ring and one below the cell ring of
 ml each one dna extraction protocol epicentre gram 
positive kit was used for phylochip comparisons the fre 
quency of detection of the genera glycomyces and legionella
increased with depth in the nycodenz gradient moreover the
populations of some genera were relatively isolated in one
fraction and undetected or at very low levels in all others e g

treponema emphasizing the value of varying the centrifuga

after the soil and cell separation different cellular lysis
protocols were used to separate the metagenomic dna as a
function of the cell wall resistance to lysis seven different
protocols were applied in addition two direct extraction pro 
tocols dna extracted directly from the soil the mp bead 
beating protocol and the mobio ultraclean soil dna kit were

applied to the soils the seven other protocols were indirect
extraction protocols cells extracted before lysis the same mp
bead beating protocol the epicentre gram positive kit the
nucleospin tissue kit and five different agarose plug protocols 
by varying the lysis stringency each lysis method facilitated the
dna extraction of a part of the microbially diverse population
to the detriment of the rest for example mp bead beating
direct dna extraction fraction of to cm facilitated the
extraction of the genera brevundimonas and mesorhizobium
but not the genera sphingobium detected only with plug lysis
protocol e or pseudomonas on the other hand indirect

bead beating dna extraction accessed more members of the
pseudomonas genus but not mesorhizobium or gloeobacter see
fig s in the supplemental material 

finally after an in plug lysis protocol b dna was sepa 
rated as a function of its size distribution by pulsed field gel
electrophoresis this separated dna based on its molecular
weight the low molecular weight to kb fraction was
extracted and analyzed directly and the dna was fragmented
so that the kb fraction was fragmented down to the same
size to kb and then analyzed by phylochip analysis

discussion

the exploration of the biodiversity in soils requires metage 
nomic approaches that extract dna from all the bacteria and
archaea present as comprehensively as is possible the scale of
the spatial variation of the microbial diversity in a soil must
influence any attempts to recover the genomes of all members
of the microbial community risa profiles showed that park
grass diversity varies both horizontally and vertically however 
the vertical variation appeared to be greater to increase the
level of biodiversity recovered from soil we applied a range of
approaches to access the metagenomic dna pool these ap 
proaches were dependent on soil depth cell separation in
density gradients cell lysis stringency and dna molecular
weight the often applied strategy of sampling different loca 
tions at the site was not the most significant factor in increasing
the level of diversity of dna extracted from the soils tested
here fig and rather the most critical strategies were
those applied to the soil samples in the laboratory to extract
and fractionate cells and dna this implies that the sample
size roughly g was sufficient to capture the majority of the
microbial community metagenome nevertheless all of the
different approaches including vertical soil sampling altered
the accessible biodiversity the relevant issue was the relative
improvement achieved with every additional dna extraction
protocol 

while all cell lysis protocols have numerous biases that limit
the diversity of the metagenomic dna extracted we used
these biases to our advantage in order to access different soil
microbial communities with different proportions of species
represented this approach separated the metagenomic dna
as a function of cell wall resistance to lysis risa analyses

showed important differences between lysis methods the pca
corresponding to risa profiles of some rothamsted soil dna
samples emphasized the importance of this step fig the
lysis protocol was the major driving force in grouping micro 
bially diverse communities and thus was a crucial step for dna
extraction differences these different lysis methods had sig 
nificant effects on the metagenomic dna extracted from a soil 
with different microbial populations being represented in each
sample fig furthermore we made an effort to access
different diverse populations with the agarose plug protocols
 five different lysis protocols so that this strategy could be
coupled with fosmid clone library production 

no one protocol can provide an accurate determination of
species distribution and therefore different dna extraction
protocols more or less stringent could be employed and the
dna pools could then be mixed together to maximize the
number of different species represented and to decrease
the proportion of the dominant species with a consequent
increase in the final level of metagenomic diversity the true
relative abundance of different species is not currently deter 
minable and both microarray approaches and attempts to val 
idate “ s” clone libraries by quantitative pcr are unfortu 
nately dealing with the same dna extraction pool e g see
reference and thus the same extraction bias nevertheless 
improved knowledge of the species present in the soil will aid
in our understanding of soil function independent of their
relative abundances since the majority of microorganisms are
probably underrepresented in soil they are not easily
accessible for study our approach was to maximize the rep 
resentation of different species in dna extracted from the
same soil using four different techniques in order to improve
our understanding of soil biodiversity 

to visualize the impact of our strategy on accessing different
levels of biodiversity in soil sample dna was analyzed with a
phylochip containing the mer complementary strands of the
 s rrna gene rrs the different strategies clearly extracted
different relative numbers of genera fig and table with
some not detecting the presence of certain genera fig

these rather large differences confirm the requirement for
multiple approaches when high levels of microbial diversity are
sought clearly there is some overlap between different dna
extraction strategies fig and in the case of different lysis
stringencies or cellular fractions in a density gradient at least
 of the biodiversity as measured by positive phylogenetic
microarray probes was detected in all dna extraction method
variations on the other hand over of the biodiversity was
detected only in individual pools of extracted dna fig 
the different approaches tested appear to access variable
quantities of phyla classes families genera and species cor 
responding to different “hits” in the ncbi database table 
some of the methods accessed a maximum amount of diversity
 e g mp direct dna extraction and plug protocol b indirect
dna extraction while others provide in depth information
on diversity e g fraction of the density gradient with the
gram positive epicentre kit or plug protocol e indirect dna
extraction which can help metagenomic dna assemblages
and provide access to generally unrepresented genetic re 
sources combining the outputs from the different methods
provides a greater level of biodiversity than any individual
approach increasing the number of hypothetical species by
 in comparison to the best individual dna extraction
method tested 

none of the different extraction protocols described here are
suitable for high throughput sequencing although pcr ap 
proaches can be easily applied to prokaryote community stud 
ies the yield is particularly low when dna is extracted from
the cell density gradient fractions above the cell ring and when
the dna is extracted from agarose gels in theory it is possible
to use whole genome amplification to increase yields but the
inherent bias in this method would considerably limit the utility
of sequencing these fractionated parts of a soil metagenome 
there is some anecdotal evidence that the lower the dna
yield the more the dna sample represents unique phyla the
challenge is to accumulate sufficient dna with low yield ap 
proaches to enable high throughput sequencing sequencing
may not be appropriate for comparisons across many samples
but is likely to be crucial when species richness and diversity

within a small number of soil samples need to be defined in
detail 

we have defined a strategy for increasing the level of detec 
tion of metagenomic dna diversity in two soils by employing
multiple dna extraction methods by comparing these multi 
ple methods we showed that the spatial distance between soil
samples did not have a major impact on the genetic diversity
that was determined in contrast to both depth and the differ 
entdnaextractionandpurificationmethods themixedmetage 
nomic dna containing products from different soil depths and
with different extraction factors density gradient cell lysis
stringency and dna molecular weight will maximize the rep 
resentation of different species although it may distort their
relative abundance at the nucleic acid level however the
“true” distribution is unknown and no existing method pro 
vides this information to the contrary most methods provide
limited views of the true soil biodiversity and it is only by
adopting a range of extraction and lysis methods that rare
species are captured thus increasing the number of species
detected table the increase in the phylochip probe diver 
sity from these different dna fractions follows standard rar 
efaction curves fig these results imply that the level of
soil diversity is greater than estimations based on one dna
extraction method e g see references and there 
fore considerable efforts and technologies are needed to ac 
cess not only dna pools but also an entire metagenome for
unbiased microbial ecology studies
