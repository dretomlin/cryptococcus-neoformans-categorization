abstract a five year site investigation was conducted at a
former chemical plant in nanjing china the main contaminants
were trichlorobenzene tcb reaching concentrations up to
 μg l dichlorobenzene dcb isomers monochlorobenzene
 mcb and benzene over time these contaminants naturally
attenuated to below regulatory levels under anaerobic conditions 
to confirm the transformation processes and to explore the
mechanisms a corresponding laboratory microcosm study was
completed demonstrating that tcb was dechlorinated to 
dcb dcb and dcb in approximately 
molar proportions the dcb isomers were dechlorinated via mcb
to benzene and finally benzene was degraded under prevailing
sulfate reducing conditions dechlorination could not be attributed
to known dechlorinators dehalobacter or dehalococcoides while
anaerobic benzene degradation was mediated by microbes affiliated to a deltaproteobacterium orm previously associated with
this activity unidentified organic compounds possibly aromatic compounds related to past on site production processes were
fueling the dechlorination reactions in situ the microcosm study confirmed transformation processes inferred from field data
and provided needed assurance for natural attenuation activity based microcosm studies are often omitted from site
characterization in favor of rapid and less expensive molecular surveys however the value of microcosm studies for confirming
transformation processes establishing electron balances assessing cocontaminant inhibition and validating appropriate
monitoring tools is clear at complex sites impacted by multiple compounds with poorly characterized transformation
mechanisms activity assays provide valuable data to incorporate into the conceptual site model to most effectively inform
remediation alternatives 

 introduction

chlorinated benzenes cbs have been widely released into the
environment as a result of their intensive use as solvents or
reactants in the manufacture of pesticides herbicides dyes and
other chemicals cbs persist in sediment accumulate in the
food chain and are potential carcinogens air sparging 

combined with soil vapor extraction groundwater pump and 
treat granular iron permeable reactive barriers and
bioremediation have all been used to remediate sites
contaminated with volatile organic compounds vocs 
including cbs of these alternatives bioremediation is a cost 
effective and long term solution in many cases although
uncertainties in the rate and extent of transformation often limit
application 
cbs can be biodegraded aerobically and anaerobically 

aerobic biodegradation of cbs has been studied extensively 

for example microbes belonging to burkholderia enter 
obacter and pseudomonas − can grow on cbs as the sole
carbon and energy source in situ the availability of dissolved
oxygen is often limiting due to low water solubility and rapid
consumption by aerobic microorganisms and the difficulty
and expense associated with injecting sufficient oxygen
underground moreover cbs may form dense nonaqueous
phase liquids dnapls and migrate to deep anaerobic regions
such as confined aquifers − making them inaccessible to
aerobic degradation thus anaerobic transformation processes
are important determinants of the fate of these compounds in

situ anaerobically cbs serve as terminal electron acceptor for
respiration and undergo sequential reductive dehalogenation to
less chlorinated products anaerobic reductive dechlorination of
cbs has been studied in a variety of mixed and some pure
cultures derived from sewage sediment soil or sludge 
dehalococcoides mccartyi dechlorinates hexachlorobenzene
 hcb pentachlorobenzene qcb and tetrachlorobenzenes
 except tecb to trichlorobenzene tcb 

dehalobium chlorocoercia df dechlorinates hcb qcb and
 tecb to tcb dehalococcoides mccartyi cbdb 
dechlorinates cbs with three or more chlorines to tcb 
and then to and dichlorobenzene dcb − d 
mccartyi dcmb dechlorinates hcb to tcb tcb 
and dcb comparatively few studies report microbes
responsible for dechlorination of lesser chlorinated dcb
isomers and monochlorobenzene mcb enrichment cultures
containing three different dehalobacter spp dechlorinated all
chlorobenzene isomers to mcb and benzene − an
anaerobic consortium capable of dechlorinating all chloroben 
zene isomers except dcb to benzene was recently
described possibly involving a geobacter sp complete
dechlorination of cbs results in the accumulation of benzene 
which is a known human carcinogen and much more toxic
than any of its chlorinated parent compounds thus
dechlorination does not always lead to detoxification 
the transformation of benzene to co completes the

detoxification process for chlorinated aromatics while benzene
is readily degraded aerobically anaerobic benzene biodegrada 
tion is much less well understood and the metabolic pathway is
still unknown benzene can be anaerobically metabolized
under iron reducing nitrate reducing sulfate reduc 
ing and methanogenic conditions and the microbes
responsible have been identified in some cases for example a
deltaproteobacterium referred to as orm was shown to be the
benzene metabolizing population under sulfate and methano 
genic conditions an enrichment culture capable of reductive
dechlorination of mcb to benzene was mixed with a benzene
degrading methanogenic culture containing orm demon 
strating transformation of mcb beyond benzene to nontoxic
co and ch in lab cultures 

 

natural attenuation at sites contaminated with chlorinated
ethenes and ethanes has been studied extensively − 

however at chlorobenzene contaminated sites most of the
previous research has focused on aerobic oxidation − 

whereas comparably less information is available on anoxic
processes especially documenting complete detoxification
of chlorobenzenes in this study a five year site investigation
was conducted at a former chemical plant contaminated with
 tcb and many other compounds in parallel a two year
anaerobic laboratory microcosm study was completed to
provide a solid basis on which to base a remediation strategy
for tcb and its daughter products at this site

and wastewater basin w w − were low or below
detection 
the last two sampling campaigns conducted in september

 and october were limited to locations s and
w results in revealed that the only contaminants close
to or above mcls were dechlorination daughter products 
dcb and mcb figure concentrations of other
compounds including tcb dcb dcb and
benzene had substantially decreased figure by all
contaminants analyzed were below their respective mcls
 figure 
three locations were sampled over multiple years to allow

direct comparisons figure at borehole s concentrations
of all compounds measured decreased to lower than respective
mcls from to figure considering the low
permeability of the clay at the site and the extremely low
groundwater velocities dilution from precipitation and ground 
water flow only played a small role in the observed decreases 
penetration of oxygen is also unlikely excluding aerobic
biodegradation rather anaerobic transformation reactions are
the most likely explanation a closer look at wells w and w 
sampled at one year intervals reveals a pattern corresponding to
reductive dechlorination where parent compound tcb
concentrations decreased while concentrations of daughter

products dcbs mcb and benzene increased figure 
concentrations of dechlorination intermediates dcb and
mcb increased the most suggesting that these compounds
were relatively more slowly degraded 
in summary the multiyear site investigation results indicated

that the contamination was primarily in the vicinity of the
former production facilities and wastewater basin in the
northeastern portion of the site the main voc released into
the groundwater was tcb used as a solvent in
production and it likely existed as a dnapl see si details 
benzene and lesser chlorinated benzenes were not used or
manufactured at the site tcb was evidently dechlorinated by
indigenous microbes to the suite of chlorobenzenes and
benzene detected at the site the site data also suggest that
the products dcb and mcb were most slowly dechlori 
nated

 data analysis and discussion

 mole and electron balances a mole balance
comparing initial to final chlorinated benzene parent and
daughter products was calculated for each microcosm table
s to verify analytical procedures and transformation products 
 tcb was primarily transformed to dcb ∼ 
with the remainder going to and dcbs this is further
confirmed in bottles and when tcb was reamended
after all vocs were purged figure a and figure s 
moreover the subsequent increase in mcb ± μmol 
approximately equals the decrease of dcb and dcb
 ± μmol the two recalcitrant compounds dcb
and mcb could be further transformed figures b c 
figures s and s b in reamended microcosms and transfers 

the overall chlorobenzene recoveries were − table
s suggesting that little conversion of mcb to benzene
occurred in the original microcosms but only later in targeted
microcosms that were reamended with dcbs or mcb 
an overall electron balance was performed to understand the

relationships between electron donors mel benzene toc 
and acceptors so 

 − co cbs in all microcosms table 
the high concentration of toc table s and sulfate table
s in the site groundwater from sulfuric acid are the result of
leaks from the chemical production processes at the site figure
s the compounds responsible for the toc serving as
electron donors are unknown but may be related to the
production process reactions described in figure s in the
electron balance we ignored electrons going to biomass
synthesis which is expected to be of total donor consumed
in these anaerobic systems given that exogenous electron
donor addition did not stimulate dechlorination we wanted to
better understand the contribution of the toc in site
groundwater to transformation processes reasonable electron
balances donor acceptor of − in the original
microcosms bottles − and in bottle t were
obtained table the consumption of toc found in the
groundwater table s accounted for a large fraction of
electron donor consumption driving sulfate reduction
primarily as well as dechlorination dechlorination accounted
for ∼ of the electrons consumed the exogenous donor
added mel did not affect dechlorination but appears to have
led simply to methanogenesis table the transformation of
chlorobenzenes and benzene was accompanied by a decrease in
toc and sulfate of the possible electron acceptors for
benzene degradation only sulfate depletion could account for
the benzene consumed table sulfate concentration in
microcosms was initially mm and decreased substantially
during benzene degradation nitrate concentrations were below

microcosms in the benzene amended transfer bottle with
little soil and defined mineral medium the electron balance was
essentially closed interestingly in microcosm bottle which
was amended with a higher concentration of benzene compared
to the other bottles in this series bottles − the toc

inhibited the degradation of the compounds measured as toc 
 microbial characterization quantitative pcr is

well accepted for tracking microbial phylotype abundances in
groundwater and microcosm samples dehalococcoides strain
cbdb and strain dcmb have been reported to
dechlorinate tcb to and dcb or dcb
only with no further dechlorination of dcb isomers reported 
certain strains of dehalobacter can dechlorinate tcb and all
dcb isomers but production of dcb from tcb has
not been seen the primers table s used in this study
specifically bind the known chlorobenzenes dechlorinating dhb
and dhc but we did not detect their growth suggesting that
other dehalogenating microbes were present particularly since
all three dcb isomers were produced from tcba
novel dechlorinating pattern figure a complete s rrna
amplicon survey is in progress and will be reported in a
subsequent manuscript 
the qpcr data clearly establish a major role for orm like

deltaproteobacteria in benzene degradation under sulfate 
reducing conditions at this site compared to other benzene 
degrading enrichment cultures in our own and other’s
laboratories the rates achieved in the transfers are − times
greater and the abundance of a similar and consistent
phylotype is exciting as it may be a valuable biomarker for
field investigations it is particularly important for remediation
to be able to observe benzene degradation in the presence of
other compounds such as mcb and in the presence of other
electron donors in order to detoxify the parent compounds in
this study benzene degradation remarkably continued in the
presence of high concentrations of unknown donors in toc
 bottles − and even in the mel donor amended bottles
 bottles benzene degradation was however 
inhibited by the addition of dcb isomers but not tcb as
seen in bottles and in these two bottles benzene was not
degraded and the corresponding copies of orm like
sequences did not increase figure b 
field implications the characterization of the site though

far from comprehensive strongly suggested that natural
attenuation of chlorobenzenes and benzene was occurring in

situ the thorough laboratory microcosm study results
confirmed that the indigenous microbes were capable of
completely transforming chlorobenzenes to nontoxic co via
benzene and provided needed assurance for affirming natural
attenuation processes in situ dcb and mcb were more
slowly transformed both at the site and in laboratory
microcosm however the latest two samples s w analyzed
in october revealed that benzene was completely
degraded and dcb and mcb concentrations had
decreased to below mcls the degradative activities recovered
from both field and lab investigations are illustrated in figure 
the microcosm activity data were essential to confirming
assumptions based on field data provided information on
relative rates provided a means to assess potential molecular
monitoring tools and brought to light the presence and
important unexpected beneficial role of unknown electron
donors and sulfate in the groundwater at the site the
surprisingly high anaerobic benzene degrading activity perhaps
enriched because of the aromatic nature of the compounds
manufactured at the site promoted the full detoxification of
 tcb dcb isomers and mcb at this site 
given the site hydrogeological conditions comprising silty

clay and clayey silt with extremely low permeability commonly
used remediation technologies such as pump and treat soil
vapor extraction and many others requiring injection are
simply impossible to implement rather future work should
continue to monitor and quantify the rate of natural attenuation
at the site monitoring key rate limiting electron donors 
further research is ongoing to determine if the indigenous
microbes at the nanjing site resemble those previously
described to degrade dcb mcb and benzene and to identify
the unknown electron donors in the site groundwater that led
to a microbial community capable of complete dechlorination
and mineralization of site contaminants
