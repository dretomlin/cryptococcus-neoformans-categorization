abstract understanding how minerals affect bacterial com 
munities and their in situ activities in relation to environmental
conditions are central issues in soil microbial ecology as min 
erals represent essential reservoirs of inorganic nutrients for
the biosphere to determine the impact of mineral type and
solution chemistry on soil bacterial communities we com 
pared the diversity composition and functional abilities of a
soil bacterial community incubated in presence absence of
different mineral types apatite biotite obsidian 
microcosms were prepared containing different liquid culture
media devoid of particular essential nutrients the nutrients
provided only in the introduced minerals and therefore only
available to the microbial community through mineral disso 
lution by biotic and or abiotic processes by combining func 
tional screening of bacterial isolates and community analysis
by bromodeoxyuridine dna immunocapture and s rrna
gene pyrosequencing we demonstrated that bacterial commu 
nities were mainly impacted by the solution chemistry at the
taxonomic level and by the mineral type at the functional

level metabolically active bacterial communities varied with
solution chemistry and mineral type burkholderia were sig 
nificantly enriched in the obsidian treatment compared to the
biotite treatment and were the most effective isolates at solu 
bilizing phosphorous or mobilizing iron in all the treatments 
a detailed analysis revealed that the s rrna gene se 
quences of the otus or isolated strains assigned as
burkholderia in our study showed high homology with effec 
tive mineral weathering bacteria previously recovered from
the same experimental site

introduction

rocks and minerals represent physical support and essential
sources of nutritive elements for the long lasting development
of the biosphere this is especially the case in the critical zone 
which encompasses from the top of the vegetation canopy to
the base of the weathered bedrock us national research
council basic research opportunities in earth science
 indeed soil is composed of mosaics of rocks and min 
erals varying in their type chemical composition size reac 
tivity and weatherability besides nutrients from atmo 
spheric deposits and the recycling of nutrients contained in
organic matter minerals represent an important reservoir of
soil inorganic nutrients however these nutrients are not di 
rectly accessible to plants and microorganisms due to the in 
ertness of rocks and minerals to environmental conditions 
certain minerals such as apatite are weathered quickly in acid 
ic conditions while minerals such as phyllosilicates remain
comparatively recalcitrant in this context all these rocks

and minerals differentially impact the biosphere due to their
different inherent properties 

for decades it is well established that mineral weathering
results from a combination of abiotic and biotic processes
contributing to the release of the chemical elements entrapped
in their crystal structure abiotic processes such as water
circulation alternative freeze–thaw events and the acidifica 
tion of their surrounding environment are known to impact
mineral stability at the same time plants fungi lichens 
and bacteria contribute to the dissolution of rocks and min 
erals – through the force applied by roots or hyphae
 on mineral particles plants and fungi are known to phys 
ically disrupt them releasing nutrients and generating new
weatherable surfaces lichens which may colonize the same
rock surface for centuries are known to produce acidifying
and chelating metabolites that contribute to mineral
weathering and lichen nutrition indeed the production
of protons organic acids and siderophores has been evi 
denced for plants and lichens as indeed for fungi and bacteria
 the role of mycorrhizal fungi in mineral
weathering is now well established their role in
the formation of tunnels into mineral particles was even pro 
posed through the symbiotic association formed with
their plant partner mycorrhizal fungi scavenge the soil envi 
ronment and transfer inorganic nutrients to the plant in ex 
change of photosynthates the contribution of soil bacterial
communities in mineral weathering nutrient cycling and
plant nutrition has also been demonstrated – 
several studies reported the presence and even the enrichment
of effective mineral weathering bacteria in the rhizosphere of
different plants suggesting an active role in nutrient mobili 
zation and plant nutrition – notably using a micro 
cosm experiment it was demonstrated that the introduction
on an effective mineral weathering bacterial strain increased
significantly mineral dissolution tree nutrition and growth
comparatively to non inoculated controls 

where the role of microorganisms in mineral 
weathering processes was evidenced it was primarily
from a plant nutrition perspective focusing mainly on
the root environment and its extensions i e rhizosphere
or mycorrhizosphere all these studies clearly highlight 
ed that the rhizosphere is a reactive interface where nutri 
ents are intensively released and a microbial habitat where
microorganisms capable of weathering minerals are
enriched however other reactive interfaces and
microbial habitats may exist among them rocks and
minerals represent a poorly investigated interface 
indeed rocks and minerals are usually considered as inert
substrata for soil microbiologists although they contain
essential nutrients and trace elements nevertheless sev 
eral studies in terrestrial and aquatic environments have
now evidenced that rocks and minerals support the devel 
opment of complex microbial communities and even

select specific microorganisms according to their physico 
chemical properties – comparing different types of
mineral inclusions present in granite gleeson et al 
 revealed that both bacterial and fungal communities
were structured according to the chemical composition of
minerals while icelandic bacterial communities were
found to differ on volcanic rocks of different chemical
composition 

together these data show that microorganisms are ca 
pable of contributing to mineral weathering nutrient cy 
cling and plant nutrition but also that their distribution
and diversity are strongly determined by the physico 
chemical properties of rocks and minerals however we
can wonder how minerals impact the functioning of soil
microbial communities a few studies performed on mod 
el fungal or bacterial strains have demonstrated that spe 
cific functions were up or downregulated when mineral
particles were introduced in the culture medium 
the possibility that introduction of minerals into the cul 
ture medium imposes upon to bacteria a stress was even
proposed by bryce et al in this context our aim in
this study was to determine whether minerals select and
stimulate specific bacterial communities we hypothesized
that minerals according to their physicochemical proper 
ties and the nutrient availability of their surrounding en 
vironment impact the diversity composition and func 
tion of the soil bacterial communities to test this hypoth 
esis microcosm experiments were developed to test how
a same bacterial community is structured by the presence
or absence of different mineral types under similar culture
conditions two culture media were adapted to create nu 
trient deficiency complementary to the nutrients contained
in these minerals in a first condition iron carrying min 
erals were incubated in a culture medium lacking iron 
while in a second condition phosphorous and calcium 
carrying minerals were incubated in a culture medium
lacking calcium and phosphorous concentrations of the
nutrients released from the introduced minerals were de 
termined in each condition after incubation to assess the
total and metabolically active bacterial communities we
combined s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing with
a bromodeoxyuridine brdu immunocapture method 
bromodeoxyuridine is incorporated into the dna of rep 
licating cells as a thymidine analogue labeling the meta 
bolically active bacterial communities – total and
brdu labelled dna were used to determine the diversity
and composition of the total and metabolically active bac 
terial communities respectively finally to assess the
mineral weathering potentials of bacteria in these different
conditions a collection of bacterial isolates coming from
the different treatments with or without minerals was
screened for the ability to solubilize phosphorus and mo 
bilize iron

for the taxonomic analysis a subsample of bacterial

representing the genera arthrobacter acinetobacter 
brachybacterium burkholderia buttiauxella dyella

pseudomonas rhodanobacter serratia silvimonas 
staphylococcus and yersinia with burkholderia being
the most abundantly represented genus at and in

analysis of the bacterial collections also highlighted that

pseudomonas were also dominant in the s rrna pyro 
sequencing data obtained from the microcosms table s 

comparison of the functional potentials with the taxonomic
affiliation of the bacterial isolates revealed that those assigned
as burkholderia were the most effective in solubilizing phos 
phorous and mobilizing iron in the bhm conditions this
relationship was not tested for the other genera due to their
low representativeness in the collection n in the

discussion

using combined culture dependent and culture independent
methods our study revealed that the diversity composition 
and function of a soil bacterial community are affected by the
solution chemistry and the presence of mineral particles in the
solut ion notably a combinat ion of dna brdu
immunocapture and s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequenc 
ing highlighted that different fractions of the total bacterial
communities are metabolically activated depending on
the mineral type present in their environment although
our experimental conditions introduced biases due to the
culture conditions this study represents to our knowl 
edge the first experiment testing the relative impact of
mineral type on complex bacterial communities coming
from forest soil 

the selective effect of minerals and rocks has now been
evidenced in several terrestrial and aquatic environments 
 – – although a consensus remains difficult to ob 
tain these studies have shown that the physicochemical prop 
erties nutritive or toxic content and weatherability of min 
erals affect the diversity and composition of the microbial
communities inhabiting their surface indeed 
according to the environmental conditions i e ph ionic
strength nutrient availability minerals can attract bacterial
cells on their surface due to their positive surface charges 
and this attraction can vary with mineral type – the
importance of the chemical content of minerals was also pro 
posed as an important driver of the development and survival
of microbial communities as an example 
nutritive elements such phosphate potassium magnesium or
iron entrapped in the crystal structure of minerals have been
shown to determine the colonization but also the composition
of the bacterial communities at the same time 
other studies proposed that other chemical elements such as
aluminium may have a toxic impact on microbial communi 
ties inhibiting the development of certain microorganisms on
their surface at last uroz et al proposed
that mineral weatherability determines the diversity and com 
position of mineral associated bacterial communities show 
ing that the most weatherable minerals were those harboring
the lowest diversity contrary to the recalcitrant minerals in
our study after days of incubation no evident effect of the
mineral type was observed in term of density diversity struc 
ture or composition of total bacterial communities in each
condition although mineral dissolution was measured in the
nbripm condition part of this absence of effect on the total
bacterial communities may be related to the short incubation
time and to the absence of biofilm formation on the mineral
surfaces whatever the conditions and treatments focusing
only on the total communities the main driver was the culture
media which vary in nutrient availability with the higher
nutrient concentration in the nbripm medium and in its

 l c kelly et al 



buffering capacity with presence of a weak buffer only in the
bhm medium 

although the total bacterial communities did not vary sig 
nificantly according to the mineral type in our study the met 
abolically active communities analyzed using dna brdu
immunocapture method differed a global analysis of the
 s rrna gene sequence distribution revealed that the meta 
bolically active communities were dominated by
gammaproteobacteria mainly assigned as unclassified
enterobacteriaceae in both bhm and nbripm conditions
and betaproteobacteria assigned as burkholderia although
nonsignificant a detailed analysis at the otu level revealed
that the main otus of unclassified enterobacteriaceae were
selectively enriched in the bhm condition in the presence of
mineral while decreased in the nbripm condition suggesting
that representatives of these taxa were reactive to mineral type
 fig s in the bhm medium which lacks iron diversity 
structure and composition of the active bacterial communities
changed depending on the mineral type our pyrosequencing
data revealed that in the same condition bhm the treatment
incubated with obsidian was significantly different from the
treatment incubated with biotite a detailed analysis of the
distribution of the s rrna gene sequences revealed that
the active communities were enriched in representatives of
gammaproteobacteria in the treatment with biotite while the
obsidian treatment was enriched in betaproteobacteria 
comparison of the partial s rrna gene sequences gener 
ated in the culturable and pyrosequencing approaches re 
vealed a good overlap with the same genera kluyvera 
dyella burkholderia phyllobacterium pseudomonas dom 
inating the dataset notably the functional screening of the
bacterial strains affiliated to some these genera i e 
burkholderia kluyvera showed they were effective to mobi 
l i z e i r on and phospho rou s i n t e r e s t i n g l y t h e
betaproteobacteria otu sequences obtained in the pyrose 
quencing analysis as well as the sanger s rrna gene se 
quences obtained for the burkholderia isolates harbored
strong homology with s rrna gene sequences of effective
mineral weathering burkholderia strains effective previously
isolated from the same experimental site suggesting that in
our microcosm conditions they were participating in mineral
weathering in the nbripm condition both total and
active communities presented a chaotic structure and were
not significantly different suggesting that in this condition
with or without minerals members of the total communities
were all metabolically actives altogether these results show
that depending of the solution chemistry and mineral type 
specific bacteria are metabolically active and may contribute
to mineral weathering 

in parallel to this cultivation independent approach func 
tional screening of bacterial strains coming from the different
conditions and treatments were assayed for their ability to
solubilize inorganic phosphorous and to mobilize iron such

approaches have been used to determine the functional struc 
ture of mineral weathering bacterial communities along soil
fertility gradient or to decipher the potential differences
existing between soil and mycor rhizosphere bacteria 
 – here we showed that effective p solubilizing
bacteria were present in the different conditions and treat 
ments but that significant variations of efficacy existed de 
pending of the mineral type if a limited effect was observed
in the bhm condition with only a significant higher efficacy
of the bacterial isolates coming from the obsidian treatment a
higher effect was observed in the nbripm condition 
frequency analysis revealed that p solubilizing ability was
enriched in the treatment with minerals comparatively to the
control without mineral with a higher proportion in presence
of apatite biotite mix than in presence of apatite another pat 
tern of distribution of the isolates in class of efficacy was
observed for the ability to mobilize iron indeed in both
bhm andnbripm conditions higher proportions of effective
iron mobilizing bacterial strains were observed in the culture
media devoid of minerals than in their presence suggesting
that iron was accessible in the different treatments containing
mineral particles such results fit very well with our knowl 
edge on the regulation of siderophore production in bacteria
 – using dna microarray on the model strain
cupriavidus metallidurans ch olsson francis et al 
highlighted a repression of the siderophore machinery in pres 
ence of basalt in the culture medium comparatively to in ab 
sence similarly page and huyer showed that introduc 
tion of different mineral types in the culture medium of a strain
of azotobacter vinerlandii allowed to a repression of
siderophore production for weatherable minerals and a de 
repression for recalcitrant minerals in our experimental con 
ditions biotite is a recalcitrant mineral comparatively to ob 
sidian and apatite which may explain why more effective
iron mobilizing bacteria were found in the treatments with
biotite whatever the functional bioassay used strains
assigned to burkholderia or kluyvera were the most effective
at mobilizing nutrients altogether our cultivation dependent
data suggest a modification of the functional structure of the
mineral weathering bacterial communities according to the
mineral type 

conclusion

this work demonstrated that minerals solution chemistry and
ph are important drivers of the taxonomic and functional
structure of bacterial communities notably the cultivation 
dependent approach revealed that in presence of mineral ef 
fective p solubilizing bacteria were enrichedwhile the propor 
tion of effective fe mobilizing bacteria decreased for the first
t ime we h igh l igh t ed us ing a combined dna 
bromodeoxyuridine immunocapture and pyrosequencing

minerals activate specific bacteria 



approach that in the same condition different mineral types
supported the activity of different parts of a same bacterial
community although we cannot exclude that introduction
of minerals into the culture medium imposed upon to bacteria
a stress as recently proposed by bryce et al our results fit
very well with the newly proposed concept of mineralosphere
 indeed this concept proposed that minerals select specific
bacterial communities according to mineral physicochemical
properties adapted to the mineral environment and actively
involved in its dissolution the physiological activation ob 
served in our study through the brdu incorporation combined
to the presence of effective mineral weathering bacteria
assigned as burkholderia or kluyvera and showing strong
homology with the s rrna pyrosequences generated sup 
port this concept further studies combining environmental
genomics and geochemical approaches will be required to
confirm these results on other minerals and in other sites and
to reveal how are in situ regulated the mineral associated bac 
terial communities and what is their relative impact onmineral
weathering and nutrient cycling however these results bring
a new perspective to soil microbial ecology as our current
knowledge of the taxonomic and functional diversity of mi 
croorganisms in soil is based mainly on composite geologi 
cally heterogeneous samples and does pay too much attention
on soil minerals and rocks
