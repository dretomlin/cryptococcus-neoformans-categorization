abstract

marine environments harbour a vast diversity of micro eukaryotic organisms protists

and other small eukaryotes that play important roles in structuring marine ecosys 

tems however micro eukaryote diversity is not well understood likewise knowledge

is limited regarding micro eukaryote spatial and seasonal distribution especially over

long temporal scales given the importance of this group for mobilizing energy from

lower trophic levels near the base of the food chain to larger organisms assessing com 

munity stability diversity and resilience is important to understand ecosystem health 

herein we use a metabarcoding approach to examine pelagic micro eukaryote commu 

nities over a year time series bimonthly surface sampling july to december

 was conducted at four locations within mobile bay bay and along the alabama

continental shelf shelf alpha diversity only showed significant differences in shelf

sites with the greatest differences observed between summer and winter beta diver 

sity showed significant differences in community composition in relation to season

and the bay was dominated by diatoms while the shelf was characterized by dinoflag 

ellates and copepods the northern gulf of mexico is heavily influenced by the

mobile river basin which brings low salinity nutrient rich water mostly during win 

ter and spring community composition was correlated with salinity temperature and

dissolved silicate however species interactions e g predation and parasitism may

also contribute to the observed variation especially on the shelf which warrants fur 

ther exploration metabarcoding revealed clear patterns in surface pelagic micro eukar 

yote communities that were consistent over multiple years demonstrating how these

techniques could be greatly beneficial to ecological monitoring and management over

temporal scales

introduction

the vast biodiversity of the marine environment is

greatly understudied especially in reference to micro 

eukaryotes which are defined as protists and other

small eukaryotes these organisms are an essential mar 

ine ecosystem component in both pelagic and benthic

environments caron et al they are important

primary producers especially in coastal environments 

playing key roles in lower portions of marine food

webs sherr sherr duffy stachowicz

 caron et al likewise they are vital to nutri 

ent and energy cycling within ecosystems caron et al 

 dortch et al duffy stachowicz

 therefore exploring micro eukaryote community

composition and variability is vital to understanding

ecosystem function as micro eukaryotes are integral to

transfer of energy between trophic levels and play a

role in the microbial loop understanding and assessing

their robustness and resiliency are paramount for main 

taining and managing healthy coastal ecosystems 

unfortunately the more open nature of pelagic systems

complicates the ability to study stability diversity or

resilience of micro eukaryote populations 

pelagic micro eukaryotes are known to differ in com 

munity composition between offshore and coastal

regions lambert et al qian et al wu et al 

 chakraborty lohrenz as well as with

water depth qian et al schnetzer et al 

kirkham et al kim et al wu et al 

their composition can drastically shift over relatively

small timescales e g days to weeks countway et al 

 vigil et al kim et al however spatial

and temporal variations over small scales are minimal

when compared to those of larger scales lie et al 

 moreover composition differences have been

shown to be greater between rather than within water

basins kirkham et al 

in the northern gulf of mexico ngom little is

known about spatial and temporal variation in pelagic

micro eukaryotic community composition lambert

et al qian et al species dominance has

been observed to be dependent on depth and proximity

to land lambert et al qian et al diatom

dominated shelf waters are associated with fresh water

outflows while prymnesiophytes and pelagophytes

dominate offshore waters in the gom lambert et al 

 qian et al suggesting fresh water inputs

influence micro eukaryote community composition the

mississippi river and mobile bay both bring fresh 

nutrient rich water to the ngom previous studies have

shown impacts of the mississippi river on small

eukaryotic community composition e g fahnenstiel

et al baguley et al chakraborty lohrenz

 while the influence of mobile bay has been less

readily examined the mobile bay river basin greatly

influences mobile bay which in return flows into the

ngom region primarily through the main pass schroe 

der kim park this river basin seasonally

inputs fresh nutrient rich water with maximum dis 

charge in winter and spring stumpf et al ortell

 ortmann how this fresh nutrient rich water

discharged from the mobile river basin influences

micro eukaryote community composition is not well

understood 

some understanding of the mobile river basin on

local communities is a result of an interdisciplinary pro 

gramme initiated in the autumn of by the dau 

phin island sea lab disl on the coast of alabama 

called the fisheries oceanography of coastal alabama

 focal e g graham et al carassou et al 

ortell ortmann ortmann ortell the

focal program included investigators from a variety

of fields whose main goal was to explore variability in

alabama’s nearshore and continental shelf environ 

ments mainly characterized by a transect of sample

sites located from within mobile bay alabama and

extending southward into the ngom region this pro 

gram’s primary focus was to assess how variability

within communities related to local fish production 

more information about the focal programme can be

found on their web page http www disl org pro 

jects article fisheries oceanography of coastal alabama

metabarcoding approaches that employ high through 

put sequencing allow for a more holistic examination of

small eukaryote community composition in comparison

with traditional methods e g light microscopy cultur 

ing and pigment analysis bik et al brannock

et al logares et al de vargas et al 

 metabarcoding approaches have been widely

used to explore composition and variation within

prokaryotic communities e g huber et al huse

et al ortmann ortell but have been less

readily implemented in eukaryotic systems when

implemented in micro eukaryotic studies researchers

have focused on sampling communities at either a sin 

gle point spatially or temporally e g amaral zettler

et al edgcomb et al logares et al 

even though one of the advantages of this approach is

the ability to quickly and holistically sample multiple

localities over many time points 

taking advantage of the focal time series data set 

we wanted to explore the spatial and temporal variation

in pelagic micro eukaryotic communities in the ngom 

we employed a metabarcoding high throughput

sequencing approach to examine micro eukaryote com 

munity composition and variation along the focal

transect over a year time series we explicitly assess

 i how micro eukaryotic community composition dif 

fers between mobile bay and ngom shelf locations and

 ii how community composition and diversity differ

over seasonal or yearly community trends the nature

of the bay vs the shelf environments allows us to pre 

dict that community composition in these regions will

be markedly different also we predict that the fresh

nutrient rich water will drive distinct micro eukaryote

community composition between sampling locations

within mobile bay and those on the more open ngom

shelf we expect that micro eukaryote communities will

be seasonally dependent and driven by river discharge 

herein we test these predictions using a high through 

put metabarcoding approach that allows for a more

holistic consideration of organismal diversity than

demonstrated previously

two pcr replicates each was performed using the bio 

diversityr package kindt coe in r ver r

development core team following brannock

et al ’s protocol all technical replicates clustered

closest with each other in reference to any other sample

 as shown in brannock et al and brannock hala 

nych therefore sequences for technical replicates

were combined and treated as one sample for the

remainder of the analyses 

in order to directly compare alpha and beta diversity

measures between different samples the number of

sequences per sample was normalized to an even num 

ber of sequences this was done to alleviate differences

observed due to difference in sequence depth a rar 

efaction analysis was conducted by subsampling the

complete data set from to sequences per

sample in steps of sequences ten replicates for

each of the ten subsampling levels were conducted an

upper limit of sequences was chosen because it

is close to the mean number of reads per sample in the

data set sequences which each of the sub 

sampling levels representing an addition of 

sequences average alpha diversity measurements for

each level were plotted against sequence depth to deter 

mine a sufficient subsampling level to be conservative

in our analyses the otu table was subsampled close to

the number of sequences in our smallest sample with

 sequences therefore all subsequent alpha and
beta diversity measurements normalized each sample to

 sequences four alpha diversity measurements

 chao phylogenetic distance pd shannon diversity

and number of otus were calculated for each normal 

ized sample along with three beta diversity measure 

ments weighted unifrac distance lozupone knight

 bray–curtis dissimilarity and binary jaccard dis 
similarity metrics all alpha and beta diversity analy 

ses were conducted in qiime 

a wilcoxon signed rank test was performed in r to

compare alpha diversities between the shelf and bay

regions a sequential bonferroni correction rice 

was applied to account for multiple tests a one way

analysis of variance anova was also performed in r to

compare alpha diversities across seasons summer 

june–august autumn september november winter 
december–february and spring march–may separately
in the bay and shelf locations if a significant difference

was obtained a tukey’s honest significant difference

 hsd test was conducted in r to examine all possible

pairwise seasonal comparisons in order to compare

community composition between years and

 between regions shelf and bay as well as sea 

sons an analysis of similarity anosim was performed

using all three beta diversity matrices in primer version

correction rice for multiple tests was applied 

likewise an examination of the environmental vari 

ables that best explains or correlates the community

bioenv analysis in primer version 

community composition

the summarize taxa through plots py script in qiime

was used to examine community composition within

samples see brannock et al when examining the

proportion of taxa due to the number of otus present

in this study and for purposes of reporting any phylum

that had an overall average abundance through 
out the whole fotu table was classified as either other

metazoa or other eukaryote phyla with average abun 

dances of ≥ were examined down to the family
level taxonomically the silva database which

was used to assign taxonomy to the otu reference

sequences frequently has taxonomic level gaps within

the sequence taxonomy string when this occurred the

highest taxonomic level below the level desired was

searched within the world register of marine species

 worms www marinespecies org database to obtain

the missing information silva assigns higher level

taxonomy to sequences using a curated phylogenetic

tree analysis whereas lower level taxa genus and spe 

cies are determined with genbank as a result there

were some discrepancies between taxonomic levels 

when this occurred in the qiime pipeline missing

information was characterized as ‘unknown’ therefore 

we took a conservative approach and limited our taxo 

nomic designations to the ordinal level families with

an average abundance across the whole fotu
table were combined into class level classifications the

same collapsing scheme was used for higher classifica 

tion levels as well for example if class classifications

represented of the fotu table they were com 
bined into phylum level classification sequences that

did not result in a taxonomic assignment when com 

pared to the silva database were reported in the

may act as mixing zone for a gradient of environmental

parameters clear differences in community composition

are found at all time points 

discernable differences along this gradient included

the greater abundances of dinoflagellates and copepods

 mainly calanoida – within shelf samples
 figs and s supporting information given samples

were prefiltered the abundance of copepods was higher

than expected however fragments of larger individuals 

earlier life stages e g eggs and larvae and small adults

may be able to go through the lm filter as previously
reported turner nichols thompson poulin

 chen marcus countway et al hidalgo

 escribano although calanoida were not found

in the bay cyclopoida were fig s supporting informa 

tion which may be due to salt tolerance physiology 

notably some cyclopoida species have a tolerance to

wider temperature and salinities ranges in comparison

with other copepod nishida as important grazers

of the phytoplanktonic community abundances of cala 

noids in ngom shelf regions signal different communi 

ties but further investigation is needed to clearly define

the drivers controlling these trophic interactions 

temporal variation

both bay and shelf regions displayed seasonality that

was influenced by riverine discharge and temperature 

but the relative roles of those factors apparently differed

in the two environments in the bay river discharge

appears to exert the greatest control on community com 

position ortell ortmann ortmann ortell

 temporal fluctuation in salinity and dsi is the

most pronounced in the bay and we accordingly

observed dominance of diatoms and dinoflagellates in

the spring and winter months when salinity was lowest

 figs and s supporting information in contrast 

chlorophytes and copepods were more dominant in sum 

mer and autumn when salinity was highest similar to

shelf regions on the shelf copepods and dinoflagellates

dominated with the former showing substantial decline

only in the winter whereas salinity did seem to impact

shelf localities the variation in salinity was lower than in

the bay fig s b supporting information thus we sus 

pect temperature may play more of a role in community

turnover if temperature fig s a supporting informa 

tion was playing a large role in variation in the composi 

tion of bay communities spring and autumn should

have been similar which they were not fig s a sup 

porting information therefore input of fresh nutrient 

rich water appears to be the more substantial driving fac 

tor in community variation and imparts seasonality to

this ecosystem 

in additional to seasonal changes in abundance we

also observed species turnover especially within

dinoflagellates in particular composition shifted

between seasons with syndiniales increasing in summer

in both localities syndiniales remained dominate until

have been shown to decrease as copepod abundance

increases implying copepods feed by grazing on

dinoflagellates countway et al within our study 

syndiniales was one of the most abundant dinoflagel 

late groups in both the bay and shelf regions fig s 

supporting information during the same seasons syn 

diniales occurred pulses of copepods were also present

 fig s supporting information several genera within

syndiniales have been reported to parasitize either

copepods or their eggs shields skovgaard et al 

 co occurrence of the two groups raises the ques 

tions about the health of the copepod population during

the time of our study as copepod abundance drops 

syndiniales could become host limited allowing other

dinoflagellate groups to dominate perhaps high 

throughput approaches such as those used here could

help monitor the health of copepod populations a key 

stone group in marine planktonic ecosystems 

benefits of metabarcoding

the high throughput metabarcoding approach used in

this study was useful for examining micro eukaryotic

community composition over space and time this

method elucidated distinct seasonal and spatial variation

and mirrors results from bacterial ortmann ortell

 and meiobenthic bik et al brannock et al 

 communities in the same geographic region 

the ability to examine a majority of organisms in

micro eukaryote communities allows for a more holistic

examination of their composition in a faster time

frame compared to traditional morphological based

approaches nonetheless this is a relatively new

approach and as with any approach has both strengths

and limitations one of the main challenges is relating the

number of sequence reads to organismal abundance

which is difficult due to variation in rrna copy number

and number of organismal cells sampled within and

between taxa prokopowich et al creer et al 

bik et al likewise taxonomic assignments espe 

cially for genus and species require molecular informa 

tion attached to properly identified vouchered

specimens despite these concerns data herein document

consistency of samples between years demonstrating

how these techniques can be greatly beneficial to ecologi 

cal monitoring and management along temporal scales 

conclusions

the ngom is a region known for being dynamic and

variable as predicted based on prior knowledge we

show both bay and shelf regions display seasonality in

community composition interestingly in the bay this

seasonality appears to be driven more by salinity and

freshwater discharge than temperature however in

shelf regions river discharge appears to have a reduced

role and temperature a greater role on community com 

position important differences in organismal composi 

tion are noted between bay and shelf samples 

particularly with regard to dinoflagellates diatoms and

copepods closer inspection of the data yielded a picture

of species turnover throughout the year perhaps the

most notable example of this was syndiniales dinoflagel 

lates whose abundances waxed and waned with cope 

pods a group they are known to parasitize moreover 

when considering previous microbial efforts with the

same samples ortell ortmann ortmann ortell

 and the copepod signatures of present data we

gain a glimpse of ecosystem coordination across three

distinct size scales the results show tight relationships

in organism turnover driven by seasonality the nature

of linkages between communities and whether control is

top down bottom up or some combination will be an

exciting area of future research
