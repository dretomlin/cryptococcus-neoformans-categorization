abstract

aim the aim of this study was to assess the biodiversity and community structure of
swedish meiofaunal eukaryotes using metabarcoding to validate the reliability of the
metabarcoding approach we compare the taxonomic resolution obtained using the
mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase coi ‘mini barcode’ and nuclear s small ribosomal
subunit s v v region with traditional morphology based identification of
xenacoelomorpha and nematoda 

location samples were analysed from two ecologically distinct locations along the west
coast of sweden replicate samples of coarse shell sand were collected along the north 
eastern side of hållö island near smögen while replicate samples of soft mud were
collected in the gullmarn fjord near lysekil

methods meiofauna was extracted using flotation and siphoning methods both coi and
 s regions were amplified from total dna samples using metazoan specific primers and
subsequently sequenced using illumina miseq producing in total paired end
reads of bp in length of which coi reads and s reads these
were quality filtered resulting in coi sequences and s sequences 
clustered into and representative otus respectively yielding metazoan
otus for coi and metazoan otus for s using a sequence similarity threshold 

results the metazoan fraction represents of the total dataset for coi otus and
 of sequences for s otus annelida of coi metazoan otus and 
of s metazoan otus and arthropoda of coi metazoan otus and of
 s metazoan otus were the most otu rich phyla identified in all samples combined as
well as annelida and arthropoda other otu rich phyla represented in our samples include
mollusca platyhelminthes and nematoda in total coi otus and s otus were
identified to species using a sequence similarity threshold revealing some non native
species and highlighting the potential of metabarcoding for biological recording taxonomic
community composition shows as expected clear differentiation between the two habitat
types soft mud versus coarse shell sand and diversity observed varies according to
choice of meiofaunal sampling method and primer pair used

introduction

microscopic interstitial marine organisms also termed ‘meiofauna’ are often defined as
animals that pass a mm mesh but are retained on a µm sieve higgins 
meiofauna are an important component of sedimentary and benthic habitats due to their
small size abundance and rapid turnover rates moreover meiofaunal surveys represent a
useful tool for environmental impact assessments underlying the urgent need for reliable 
reproducible and rapid analytical methods the breadth of taxonomic groups present in
marine sediments makes meiofauna an ideal tool for detecting the effects of ecological
impacts on marine biodiversity moreno et al however traditional morphology
based taxonomy assignment methods are labour intensive and time consuming leading us
to explore recently developed metabarcoding methods for whole community analysis 
metabarcoding has previously been used to characterize plankton assemblages lindeque

in this study we used samples from muddy and sandy marine sediments to examine how
results of metabarcoding based surveys of meiofaunal communities are impacted by three
different meiofaunal extraction methods and three different primer pairs for coi and s in
order to validate the reliability of the metabarcoding approach we compare the results
obtained with traditional morphology based taxonomic assignment for two test groups 
xenacoelomorpha and nematoda the latter previously shown to be the dominant taxon in
meiofaunal communities in terms of number of otus fonseca et al 

materials and methods

sampling

samples were collected in two ecologically distinct locations along the west coast of
sweden in august 

hållö island samples coarse shell sand was sampled by dredging at m depth along
the north eastern side of hållö island near smögen sotenäs municipality västra
götalands county n ° e ° 

gullmarn fjord samples soft mud was collected using a waren dredge at m depth in
the gullmarn fjord near lysekil lysekil municipality västra götalands county n °
 e ° 

meiofaunal extraction

hållö island hållö island samples were extracted in the lab using two different variations
of the flotation decanting and sieving technique 

flotation freshwater freshwater was used to induce an osmotic shock in meiofaunal
organisms and force them to detach from heavy sediment particles ml of sediment
were placed in a large volume of fresh water and thoroughly mixed to suspend meiofauna

 haenel q et al



and lighter sediment particles the supernatant was sieved through a µm sieve to
separate the macrofaunal fraction which was then discarded the filtered sample was
sieved again through a µm sieve to collect meiofauna and discard fine organic particles 
this procedure was repeated three times meiofauna was then rinsed with seawater from
the sieve into large falcon tubes twelve sediment samples were processed ten of them
were fixed immediately in ethanol for molecular analysis and stored at °c the
other two samples were first screened for live representatives of xenacoelomorpha and
later preserved in formaldehyde for morphology based identification of nematodes 

flotation mgcl solution a solution of mgcl was used to anesthetize meiofauna 
as above twelve samples were processed in total ten of them were decanted through 
µm sieve and fixed immediately in ethanol for molecular analysis and stored at °c 
while two samples were decanted through a µm sieve which was subsequently placed
in a petri dish with seawater after minutes the petri dish as well as the inside of the
sieve were searched for xenacoelomorpha using a stereo microscope afterwards they
were preserved in formaldehyde for morphology based identification of nematodes 

gullmarn fjord meiofauna was extracted from the gullmarn fjord samples using two
different methods flotation and siphoning 

flotation freshwater freshwater was used to induce an osmotic shock in meiofaunal
organisms l of sediment were placed in a large volume of freshwater thoroughly
mixed to suspend meiofauna and lighter sediment particles the supernatant was sieved
through a µm sieve in order to separate macrofauna which was then discarded the
filtered sample was then sieved three times through a µm sieve to collect meiofauna and
discard fine organic particles meiofauna was then rinsed with seawater from the sieve into
a large container and equally divided between falcon tubes six samples were fixed in
 ethanol for molecular analysis and stored at °c six samples were screened for
live representatives of xenacoelomorpha and preserved in formaldehyde for
morphology based identification of nematodes 

siphoning a total volume of l of sediment was processed as follows an approximately
 cm thick layer of mud was placed in a container and covered with cm of seawater 
the sediment was allowed to settle for hours half of the sediment area was then
siphoned through a µm sieve the residue in the sieve was immediately fixed in 
ethanol large macrofauna was manually removed and the entire volume was split equally
into six samples and placed at °c for subsequent molecular analysis the remaining
half of the area was similarly siphoned through a µm sieve the sieve contents were
stored in sea water large macrofauna manually removed the entire volume split into six
samples which were screened for live representatives of xenacoelomorpha and
preserved in formaldehyde for morphology based identification of nematodes 

morphology based identification

xenacoelomorpha four samples from hållö and samples from gullmarn fjord were
used for morphology based assessment of the diversity of xenacoelomorpha all samples

ngs based biodiversity and community structure analysis of meiofaunal eukaryotes 



were stored in seawater and searched for xenacoelomorpha with a stereo microscope all
specimens found were immediately identified to the lowest taxonomic rank possible using a
compound microscope equipped with dic 

nematoda two samples from each location extraction method were used to assess
nematode diversity using morphology based identification samples from hållö flotation
with fresh water and mgcl and gullmarn fjord siphoning were processed whole and
samples from gullmarn fjord extracted using flotation with fresh water were subsampled
by taking of the entire sample formaldehyde–preserved samples were transferred to
glycerin using seinhorst’s rapid method as modified by de grisse permanent
nematode mounts on glass slides were prepared using the paraffin wax ring method it is
common practice to estimate the diversity of marine nematodes by counting a
predetermined number usually or of randomly picked nematodes per sample
 vincx which may not provide sufficiently detailed results for samples with high
diversity therefore all nematode specimens were counted and identified for each
analyzed sample all nematode specimens were identified to genus and when possible to
species level 

dna extraction library preparation and sequencing

dna extraction samples were processed for total dna extraction twelve from the
gullmarn fjord and eighteen from hållö island using g of sediment and the powermax
soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories according to manufacturer’s instructions 

primer design illumina miseq reagent v produces paired end reads of bp in length 
allowing a maximum marker length of bp when taking into account a bp overlap 
universal coi primers available for the metazoa amplify a bp region folmer et al 
 which is too long for most ngs applications 

accordingly primers amplifiying a bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome
oxidase coi gene were used as described in bourlat et al the primers used for
coi are modified from leray et al ’s ‘mini barcode’ coi primers mlcoiintf dghco 
leray et al by adding the illumina miseq overhang adapter sequences the leray et
al ‘mini barcode’ primers have been shown to amplify up to of metazoan diversity in a
sample leray et al in combination with leray et al s mini barcode forward primer
 mlcoiintf we used folmer et al s coi reverse primer dghco folmer et al 
as well as a reverse primer developed by lobo et al shown to enhance amplification of the
coi region in a wide range of invertebrates lobo et al 

for the s region illumina overhang adapter sequences were appended to the primers
from fonseca et al ssu fo ssu r fonseca et al yielding a bp
fragment these primers target a homologous region of the gene and flank a region that is
highly divergent corresponding to the v v region of the s gene lindeque et al

illumina miseq library preparation using fusion primers for illumina miseq library
preparation we used a dual pcr amplification method as described in bourlat et al 
 the first pcr the amplicon pcr uses amplicon specific primers including the
illumina adapter overhang as described above the second pcr the index pcr allows
the incorporation of illumina index adapters using a limited number of cycles bourlat et al 
 

amplicon pcr pcr amplifications of the coi and s regions were set up as follows 
for a µl reaction volume we used µl pfu polymerase buffer x µl dntp mix final
concentration of each dntp µm µl of each primer at pm µl µl dna template

agarose gel µl of each pcr reaction were then purified with agencourt ampure xp
paramagnetic beads beckman coulter allowing size selection of pcr fragments by using
different pcr product to bead ratios bourlat et al 

index pcr for dual indexing we used the nextera xt index kit indices samples 
illumina according manufacturers’ instructions dual indexing allows an increase in the
multiplex level of sequencing per lane so that more samples can be sequenced on the
same flow cell fadrosh et al it also eliminates cross contamination between
samples and the occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow cell kircher et al the

paired end joining 

demultiplexed miseq paired end reads were joined using the qiime script
multiple join paired ends py using the fastq join tool https code google com p ea utils 
wiki fastqjoin data from three sequencing runs were merged producing a total of 
 raw paired end reads reads for the coi dataset and reads for
the s dataset table the number of reads remaining after various bioinformatic data
processing steps is presented in table after paired end joining of sequences were
lost leading to a total of reads due to an observed decrease in sequence
quality at the end of the reads resulting in a bad overlap between the paired ends this
loss is much more important for the longer s region reads after joining 
corresponding to a loss than for the coi region reads after joining 
corresponding to a loss

primer trimming and quality filtering 

dual indexes and illumina overhangs were removed by the sequencing platform coi and
 s primer sequences were removed using a custom python script designed for this study 
https github com quiterie primer removal the script retains and trims reads that
have the exact sequence of the forward and reverse primers at the beginning and at the
end of the reads respectively while other reads not meeting these criteria are discarded 
the script takes into account the presence of ambiguous bases in the primer sequence
 such as w r s y m k h d b and v in the case that an unassigned base n is found
in the primer sequence the read is also discarded the primer trimming step resulted in 
 reads remaining corresponding to a loss as the script is quite stringent it
quality filters reads by removing incomplete reads or chimeras at this step 
reads remained after trimming for the s dataset corresponding to a loss and 
 reads remained after trimming for the coi dataset corresponding to a loss a
quality filtering step was then carried out using the qiime script multiple split 
libraries fastq py to remove reads with a q score inferior to corresponding to a base
call accuracy of at least a total of of sequences were lost after the quality 
filtering step leading to reads remaining of the reads were lost in the s

chimera removal and otu clustering 

chimeric reads were removed with uchime edgar et al using the qiime scripts
identify chimeric seqs py followed by filter fasta py based on the usearch software 
after chimera removal sequences remained in the coi dataset loss and
 sequences remained in the s dataset loss 

for clustering sequences into operational taxonomic units otus we used crop a
bayesian clustering algorithm that delineates otus based on the natural distribution of the
data using a gaussian mixture model hao et al the program allows the user to
define a lower and upper bound variance to cluster the sequences instead of a fixed
sequence similarity value according to a benchmarking study by leray et al based on the
moorea biocode barcode library http mooreabiocode org leray et al the best
lower and upper bound values to cluster metazoan coi sequences are and 
corresponding to sequence dissimilarities between and according to an s
benchmarking experiment with a set of known nematode species carried out by
porazinska et al a threshold most accurately reflects taxonomic richness yielding 
octus whereas a threshold yielded octus porazinska et al according
to this benchmark a range of sequence dissimilarities between and were used in
crop and respectively for the lower and upper values corresponding to 
similarity

taxonomic assignment 

as qiime is normally used for metagenomic analyses of prokaryotes default databases are
not suited for taxonomic assignment of metazoa custom databases consisting in a
taxonomy file associated with a reference sequence file can be created or alternatively a
preformatted database such as the silva database http www arb silva de no cache 
download archive qiime can be used for the coi region a custom database of 
 sequences was created consisting of the bold database http 
www boldsystems org downloaded on october combined with own reference
databases of nemertea xenacoelomorpha and oligochaeta and barcodes of swedish
echinodermata mollusca cnidaria and arthropoda from the swedish barcode of life
database swebol for the s rrna region a custom database of reference
sequences was created using the silva database release http www arb silva de 
no cache download archive qiime and own barcodes for acoela and oligochaeta 
corresponding tab delimited taxonomy files were created including a sequence id and
taxonomic lineage information phylum class order family genus and species derived
from bold swebol silva and worms http www marinespecies org 

taxonomic assignments were carried out using both and sequence similarity
thresholds to obtain identifications at phylum and species levels respectively giongo et al

 lanzén et al yielding metazoan otus for coi and metazoan otus
for s at threshold and metazoan otus for coi and metazoan otus for
 s at threshold for coi taxonomic assignment was done with the qiime script
assign taxonomy py using the uclust software edgar with uclust a query
sequence matches a database sequence if the identity is high enough the identity is
calculated from a global alignment which differs from blast and most other database
search programs which search for local matches by default uclust stops searching when
it finds a match but also stops searching if it fails to find a match after eight failed attempts 
within qiime uclust is the default algorithm for the assign taxonomy py script and two
parameters are associated to the algorithm the minimum fraction of database hits that
must have a specific taxonomic assignment to assign that taxonomy to a query that was
fixed at and the number of database hits to consider when making an assignment that
was fixed at corresponding to the default values to obtain matches for non metazoan
taxa a megablast search with minimum coverage was done against the genbank nt
 nucleotide database ftp ftp ncbi nlm nih gov blast db downloaded on june 
using geneious kearse et al for taxonomic assignment of the s dataset the
qiime script assign taxonomy py was used with uclust edgar default settings
against the silva database some taxonomic errors were detected for nematodes in the
silva database 

note on the taxonomic assignement of nematodes the output from the qiime analysis
included s otus assigned to the phylum nematoda three of them
 he ssu he ssu and hf ssu suppl material were
incorrectly placed among the nematodes due to errors in the reference database they
derived from – they group among arthropod taxa by the megablast search and were
excluded for that reason another otu ts ssu is placed among phoronida by
the megablast search and was also excluded two more sequences that were assigned to
nematoda appear to have long insertions within conserved regions he ssu and
tf ssu both of them were found only in one sample each further supporting
the idea that they are derived from erroneous amplification product and were removed
from any further analysis 

invasive alien species ias were detected in our samples by comparing our species list
 suppl material to the helcom ospar list http www helcom fi about us partners ospar 
and the swedish främmande arter invasive species lists http www frammandearter se 

taxonomic composition bar plots fig were created using otu tables suppl materials
 and the qiime scripts make otu table py split otu table by taxonomy 
merge otu table py and summarize taxa through plots py the bar plots created for fig 
 take into account the relative abundance or number of reads for each otu whereas

diversity analyses 

alpha and beta diversity analyses were carried out with and without unassigned otus for
both coi and s datasets unassigned otus were removed using the qiime script
filter otus from otu table py alpha diversity species richness was calculated using the
nonparametric chao index using rarefied datasets to correct bias in species number due
to unequal sample size one of the samples in the coi dataset was removed prior to
rarefaction analysis due to low sequence number sequences including unassigned
otus and sequences excluding unassigned otus at sequence similarity using
the qiime script filter sample from otu table py rarefaction alpha diversity calculation
and generation of plots were performed using the qiime scripts i multiple rarefactions py

was done to a depth corresponding to the total number of sequences in the smallest
dataset sequences including unassigned otus and sequences excluding
unassigned otus at sequence similarity for coi and sequences including
unassigned otus and sequences excluding unassigned otus at sequence
similarity for s alpha diversities were compared between locations and extraction

methods for both datasets and coi primer sets using the qiime script
compare alpha diversity py the script performs monte carlo permutations to determine p 
values 

beta diversity was calculated using the abundance based bray curtis index for both coi
and s datasets the qiime script beta diversity through plots py was used to compute
beta diversity distance matrices from the rarefied samples and generate principal
coordinate analysis pcoa plots beta diversity was compared according to location 
extraction method and primer pair both with and without the unassigned otus using the
qiime script compare categories py the script uses r and the vegan and ape libraries to
compute statistical tests we performed anosim analysis of similarity tests which are
nonparametric through permutations this method tests whether two or more groups
of samples are significantly different by taking as null hypothesis that there is no difference
between the two or more groups studied 

alpha and beta diversities were calculated including and excluding the unassigned otus
and results obtained were similar here we present plots including the unassigned otus

results and discussion

phylum level community composition of meiofaunal samples from the swedish
west coast

illumina miseq produced at total of raw reads of which coi reads
and s reads these were quality filtered see methods section for details 
resulting in coi sequences and s sequences these were clustered
into and representative otus respectively yielding metazoan otus for coi
and metazoan otus for s at sequence similarity see methods table fig 
 

taxonomic assignment of otus at a similarity threshold shows community
composition of the samples at the phylum level fig of coi otus were
assigned to the metazoa to plants and algae to fungi otus
remained unassigned corresponding to of coi otus

for the s dataset of otus were assigned to metazoa to
plants and algae to fungi and to protozoa otus remained
unassigned corresponding to of all s otus 

the large numbers of unassigned otus reflect the incompleteness of the databases used
for coi and s when unassigned otus are disregarded differences between the
taxonomic ocverage of the markers can be observed fig b and d coi is the
‘standard’ animal barcode and is thus mostly useful for diversity surveys within the metazoa
 hebert et al s has on the other hand much larger taxonomic coverage and can
be used for biodiversity profiles of whole eukaryotic communities at higher taxonomic
scales 

of all otus classified as metazoa a detailed breakdown per phylum is presented in table
 and fig annelida of co metazoan otus and of s metazoan otus 
and arthropoda of co metazoan otus and of s metazoan otus 
were the most otu rich phyla identified in all samples combined a similar pattern as
observed in a recent study on coastal seagrass meadows in brittany france cowart et al 
 

as well as annelida and arthropoda other phyla represented by a high number of otus in
our samples include mollusca of coi metazoan otus and of s
metazoan otus platyhelminthes of s metazoan otus and of co 
metazoan otus and nematoda of s metazoan otus and of co metazoan
otus table fig other benthic metabarcoding studies based on the s v v 
region found nematoda and platyhelminthes as the most otu rich phyla represented
 fonseca et al fonseca et al or nematoda and annelida bik et al b 
alternatively nematoda and arthropoda bik et al a lallias et al 

meiofaunal community composition differs according to location

taxonomic community composition at both locations surveyed is illustrated in fig the
bar plots in fig take into account the read counts for each otu whereas table and
fig do not take these into account 

in fig clear differentiation in biodiversity between the two habitat types soft mud versus
coarse shell sand can be observed as expected echinodermata such as ophiurida 
echinoidea and asteroidea mollusca bivalvia gastropoda annelida and arthropoda are
represented by higher numbers of reads in samples from the muddy sediments in the
gullmarn fjord samples grain size μm approx 

in coarse shell sand in shallow areas such as in the hållö island samples annelida and
arthropoda are represented by higher numbers of reads followed by chordata
 cephalohordata such as branchiostoma sp ascidians and various fish species such as
gobius sp ctenolabrus rupestris solea solea with in addition a larger diversity of small
taxa such as bryozoa gnathosthomulida gastrotricha tardigrada rotifera sipuncula
and phoronida reflecting the high diversity of insterstitial taxa found in sandy sediments

sample diversity and composition analyses

a greater number of phyla were uncovered in the hållö island samples than in the
gullmarn fjord samples fig a and b and this observation was corroborated by the
alpha diversity rarefaction plots showing that hållö island samples in red present a higher
diversity than the gullmarn fjord samples in blue p value regardless of the
marker used fig a and b within the same location choice of extraction method does
not have a significant impact on sample diversity p value fig c and d table 
however for the s dataset the flotation method seems to be more effective for
extraction of nematodes than the siphoning method in the gullmarn fjord samples fig a
and b moreover the beta diversity pcoa results highlight the fact that sample
composition is influenced by the choice of extraction method for both coi and s
datasets p value leading to four different clusters fig and b table for the
coi dataset in addition to extraction method as a factor of divergence choice of primer
 coi leray or coi lobo also influences the grouping of the samples p value 
excluding unassigned otus and including unassigned otus in particular for the
hållö island samples fig c moreover the coi lobo primer seems to uncover a higher
diversity of taxa than the coi leray primer fig e even if the results are considered to be
non significant p value excluding unassigned otus and including
unassigned otus table table

molecular identifications to species level

using a sequence similarity search at similarity allowed us to identify coi otus
and s otus to species level table and suppl material for the coi dataset 
 species of which metazoans were found in both locations of which 
metazoans were found in the gullmarn fjord only and of which metazoans were
found in hållö island only for the s dataset species of which metazoans were
found in both locations of which metazoans were found in the gullmarn fjord only
and of which metazoans were found in hållö island only suppl material these
species observations from metabarcoding represent molecular occurrence records that
could be used in monitoring and other types of biodiversity surveys in the same way as
physical observations such as for mapping species distributions bohmann et al

invasive and alien species detected in the samples

five alien species were detected in in the sample of which two are considered invasive in
bold table and the other three are on alert lists the two invasive species acartia 
tonsa a copepod and alexandrium ostenfefeldii a dinoflagellate could easily be
overlooked in routine monitoring programs species within the genus acartia are difficult to
distinguish jensen and the invasive species can be confused with other native
species also a ostenfeldii is easily misidentified as other alexandrium species detailed
thecal plate observation is often necessary for proper identification balech this
shows the potential of molecular techniques for monitoring invasive species and points to
problems using traditional identification techniques many invasive species arrive in an area
as spores larvae or juveniles all life stages that may be easily overlooked and
problematic to identify to species level target barcoding of environmental dna edna 
shows a great promise for detecting species without the need of costly sampling schemes 
this would also allow for more random sampling in an area increasing the probability of
actually finding a species even when they occur in low numbers

comparison of metabarcoding versus morphology based identification of
xenacoelomorpha 

comparison of morphology based assessment of xenacoelomorpha diversity with
metabarcoding using taxonomic assignments to the phylum level with similarity
threshold suppl materials shows that extraction procedures have strong impact on
the effectiveness of morphology based identification tables using freshwater for
extraction of xenacoelomorpha rendered most of them unrecognizable and unidentifiable 
but left their dna intact and suitable for metabarcoding no identifiable xenacoelomorpha
were found in the hållö samples extracted using flotation with fresh water while all
specimens found in gullmarn fjord were treated together as one taxon acoela sp for the
lack of better alternative metabarcoding on the other hand recovered between and 
taxa otus from the hållö samples extracted using flotation with fresh water table 
and up to taxa otus from the same type of samples from the gullmarn fjord site
 table depending on the barcoding region used just like for nematodes see below 
 s barcodes always gave higher overall estimates of diversity number of otus 
compared to coi table s also gave higher diversity estimates compared to
morphology based identification for the hållö samples extracted using flotation with mgcl 
 versus but lower for the gullmarn fjord site samples extracted using siphoning 
versus coi leray primers were less effective compared to the coi lobo primers that
recovered otus more in all samples table the most numerous of the
morphologically identified species mecynostomum tenuissimum was present with 
specimens in the manually sorted samples but was not detected at all in the s
samples note that the s and coi sequences for all of the species identified in the
visually sorted samples are present in the reference database this raises the question of
the efficiacy of using the ssu fo ssu r s fragment for metabarcoding of
acoelomorphs a recent study found a number of unknown xenacoelomorph taxa while
data mining metabarcoding sequences from surveys of pelagial and deep benthic habitats
 arroyo et al unknown xenacoelomorph species may exist also at the moderate
sampling depths we sampled in the gullmarn fjord our siphoning technique relies on
migration of specimens to the sediment surface in response to hypoxia it is possible that

where the species were found 

ngs based biodiversity and community structure analysis of meiofaunal eukaryotes 



there are xenacoelomorphs with high tolerance for hypoxia that are not captured by the
siphoning method and thus would not be found in the manually sorted samples but could
be detected by metabarcoding of unprocessed samples it should be noted that the
extraction method used on the hållö samples does not rely on migration of specimens to
the surface

comparison of metabarcoding versus morphology based identification of
nematoda 

both study sites are characterized by rich and diverse nematode fauna the hållö site had
a total of species of nematodes belonging to genera holovachov et al of
these species belonging to genera were found in samples extracted by flotation with
a mgcl solution and species belonging to genera were found in samples
extracted by flotation with fresh water the gullmarn fjord site had a total of nematode
species of nematodes belonging to genera holovachov et al of these 
species belonging to genera were found in samples extracted by siphoning and 
species belonging to genera were found in samples extracted by flotation with fresh
water a certain small number of nematode individuals in each sample were not identified
to species genus family either due to their developmental stage or quality of preservation 

the final list of nematode otus includes s sequences only two s otus were
positively identified using qiime to species level using similarity threshold viscosia 
viscosa ts ssu and chromadora nudicapitata hf ssu six more were
assigned to reference sequences identified to genus level only suppl material only 
coi sequences were assigned to the phylum nematoda and none was identified to
species level 

when comparing the results of morphology based assessment of nematode diversity with
metabarcoding using taxonomic assignments to the phylum level in this particular study
 with similarity threshold suppl materials the detailed and extensive
examination of samples and morphology based species identification provided more
comprehensive estimates of nematode diversity species in hållö and species in
gullmarn fjord than metabarcoding using either one of the molecular markers 
independently of the extraction technique or locality table moreover coi barcodes
were much harder to obtain for marine nematodes using either one of the primers 
otus in hållö and otus in gullmarn fjord using lobo primers otus in hållö and 
otus in gullmarn fjord using leray primers comparing to s otus in hållö and
