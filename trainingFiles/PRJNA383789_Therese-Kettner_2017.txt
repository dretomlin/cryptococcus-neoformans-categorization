summary

despite increasing concerns about microplastic mp 

pollution in aquatic ecosystems there is insufficient

knowledge on how mp affect fungal communities in

this study we explored the diversity and community

composition of fungi attached to polyethylene pe 

and polystyrene ps particles incubated in different

aquatic systems in north east germany the baltic

sea the river warnow and a wastewater treatment

plant based on next generation s rrna gene

sequencing different operational taxonomic

units assigned to fungal taxa were identified on pe

and ps the mp associated communities were dis 

tinct from fungal communities in the surrounding

water and on the natural substrate wood they also

differed significantly among sampling locations 

pointing towards a substrate and location specific

fungal colonization members of chytridiomycota 

cryptomycota and ascomycota dominated the fungal

assemblages suggesting that both parasitic and sap 

rophytic fungi thrive in mp biofilms thus 

considering the worldwide increasing accumulation

of plastic particles as well as the substantial vector

potential of mp especially these fungal taxa might

benefit from mp pollution in the aquatic environment

with yet unknown impacts on their worldwide distri 

bution as well as biodiversity and food web

dynamics at large 

introduction

microplastics mp widely defined as plastic

particles mm in size have been detected in aquatic

systems all over the globe including oceans freshwaters 

polar environments and also pristine mountain lakes or at

beaches of remote and uninhabited islands ivar do sul

et al free et al obbard et al wagner

et al eerkes medrano et al lavers and

bond law mp can enter the aquatic environ 

ments directly via the spillage of industrial resin pellets or

through the effluent of wastewater treatment plants as cos 

metic microbeads or fibres of synthetic clothing browne

et al cole et al in addition mp derives

from the breakdown of larger plastic items originating for

instance from illegal dumping lost fishing gear or improp 

erly managed landfills law approximately 

trillion particles with a weight of metric tons are

estimated to float in the oceans van sebille et al 

but these numbers will likely rise due to increasing plastic

production fragmentation and extremely low biodegrad 

ability barnes et al an unknown fraction of plastic

debris is washed ashore or sinks to the seafloor barnes

et al tekman et al mp provide artificial and

persistent surfaces which can be colonized by numerous

microorganisms as reviewed by oberbeckmann et al 

 as buoyant plastic particles can be transported

over long distances law and thompson along

with their attached biota they also serve as vectors for var 

ious microorganisms including potentially pathogenic

bacteria kirstein et al and harmful algal species

m in the ocean with a diameter of mm mp could pro 

vide a surface area of million km which is around

twice as much as the area of greenland charette and

smith hidalgo ruz et al eriksen et al 

 this represents a potentially large surface

available for microbial colonization on mp which may alter

community compositions and functions with possible con

although this research field has recently been pushed for 

ward zettler et al we are still far from

understanding the ecological effects of microbial mp

colonization 

within the microbial communities of plastic biofilms 

fungi have been almost completely overlooked fungi hold

many important ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems 

that is as decomposers of organic matter b€arlocher and

boddy grossart and rojas jimenez para 

sites of several algae or other organisms gleason et al 

 wurzbacher et al and as food source for

higher trophic levels kagami et al moreover fungi

can be predators endophytes symbionts or pathogens

 wurzbacher et al the application of next genera 

tion sequencing has led to an increasing discovery rate of

fungal taxa in aquatic ecosystems especially within the

early diverging lineages such as chytridiomycota and

cryptomycota richards et al comeau et al 

grossart et al investigations of the functional roles

of these lineages have recently led to fundamental revi 

sions in the concept of aquatic food web structures 

emphasizing their profound relevance in aquatic ecosys 

tems kagami et al grossart and rojas jimenez 

 in addition fungi are of special interest for potential

plastic decomposition in the environment due to their vast

metabolic potential and ability to degrade recalcitrant struc 

tures krueger et al grossart and rojas jimenez 

 however to date a single study has reported on

the presence of fungi on plastic bottles made of polyethyl 

ene terephthalate pet but insights into fungal diversity

and their ecological meaning remained peripheral

 oberbeckmann et al 

we applied illumina sequencing of the hypervariable v 

region of the s rrna gene to analyse the fungal com 

munities on mp and compared them to communities in the

surrounding water and to the natural substrate wood mp

and wood particles were incubated for days at seven

stations located in north east germany with five stations

along the lower course of the river warnow up to the coast

of the baltic sea fig and two stations inside a

wastewater treatment plant wwtp the baltic sea is a

brackish and highly anthropogenically influenced ecosys 

tem conley et al and rivers in densely populated

areas can be important pathways for transporting plastic

litter to the open sea lechner et al while wwtps

are considered as relevant point sources of mp mintenig

et al the polymers in our study – high density

polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps – rank among the

most commonly produced plastic polymers and have been

frequently found as pollutants in aquatic environments

 claessens et al wagner et al 

with this work we aimed to unveil the fungal diversity

within mp biofilms and examined the effects of substrate

type and location on fungal diversity community composi 

tion and their abundance in relation to other eukaryotes on

mp we hypothesized that fungi are frequent members of

mp attached communities occurring preferentially on solid

substrates compared to living freely in the surrounding

water as numerous fungal species are capable of degrad 

ing wood but only very few might be able to use plastic

polymers as an energy source krueger et al we

expected to see a clear preference of certain fungi towards

wood resulting in a comparably higher fungal abundance

on wood and a distinction between mp and wood 

associated communities lastly we hypothesized that also

location significantly alters fungal community composition 

allowing to determine location specific fungal otus 

herein we provide the first detailed report about mp 

colonizing fungi while pointing out differences to water and

wood communities as well as among study sites

discussion

this is one of the first reports showing that the presence of

mp alters the composition of eukaryotic microbial commu 

nities in aquatic ecosystems mp were easily colonized by

different microorganisms including an abundant diversity

of fungi this recalcitrant surface could be considered a

new hotspot for the growth of fungal communities whose

structure and composition differed significantly from that

found in the surrounding water or other natural solid sub 

strate such as wood furthermore mp associated fungal

communities were shown to vary significantly among sites 

which may have profound environmental and ecological

implications for example microplastic contaminants could

collect transport and disperse a number of non resident

microorganisms including pathogens from wwtps along

their transit from land based to marine systems 

previously oberbeckmann et al examined the

presence of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms on

pet bottles in the north sea and reported only fungal

otus assigned to ascomycota basidiomycota and chytri 

diomycota in our study the observed fungal richness and

diversity were significantly higher with up to otus per

sample mostly assigned to chytridiomycota and crypto 

mycota and to a lesser extend to ascomycota and

basidiomycota ascomycota were previously assumed to

be the most prevalent group within aquatic fungal commu 

nities shearer et al jones and pang 

however recent studies based on culture independent

methods are revealing high proportions of chytridiomycota

in various aquatic ecosystems richards et al 

comeau et al which is consistent with our findings 

interestingly in the wwtp the two most dominant taxa

were assigned to lkm cryptomycota and lkm the

predominance of lkm in a wwtp has been reported

before matsunaga et al but the ecological role of

members of this lineage is still unclear grossart et al 

 

in our study we detected a clear differentiation between

the fungal communities in the water column and those

associated with solid substrates distinctions between

plastic and water communities have also been found in

studies of other microorganisms zettler et al 

 m t kettner et al 

vc society for applied microbiology and john wiley sons ltd environmental microbiology – 



hoellein et al mccormick et al oberbeck 

mann et al the higher relative abundance of fungi

on pe ps and wood is likely a result of the higher affinity

of certain fungal species to attach to solid surfaces

 richards et al or to establish specific relationships

with other substrate attached organisms as might be the

case for some parasitic chytrids wurzbacher et al 

gleason et al potential hosts could be some of the

numerous eukaryotes that were present in the mp biofilms 

for example chlorophyta rhodophyceae dinophyceae 

diatomea nematoda rotifera and crustacea kettner

et al in preparation the observed differences between

mp and wood associated communities sampled from the

river warnow and the baltic sea further indicate that

there are specific preferences for certain substrate types 

for example yeasts such as candida or ogataea exhib 

ited a strong preference for wooden substrates as they

are probably able to degrade wood constituents like xylose

and cellulose schauer and hanschke high num 

bers of ascomycota on decaying wood have also been

found by r€am€a et al in contrast to wood and mp 

we did not detect significant distinctions between pe and

ps associated communities compared to natural surfaces

in aquatic environments for example river snow or plant 

litter both mp types appear to have rather similar surface

attributes like a high hydrophobicity and a smooth surface

which are relevant factors for cell adhesion and biofilm for 

mation donlan renner and weibel 

nevertheless fungal communities on pe and ps had a

bray–curtis similarity of only hinting at an influence of

plastic type on colonization as shown by zettler et al 

beside the differences in community composition

between water and solid substrates the nmds plot illus 

trates a superior grouping of samples by location it

suggests that the surrounding water – including its local

environmental parameters and source communities –

were shaping fungal colonization patterns on pe ps and

wood these results furthermore expand the notion of pos 

sible habitat and location specificity of fungi monchy et al 

 panzer et al wurzbacher et al also

in our study each location was significantly different from

any other location regarding their fungal community com 

position with the exception of stations and which are

located geographically close to each other one of the pos 

sible factors influencing the presence of fungi might be the

nutrient concentration as we detected the highest relative

fungal abundances at stations located inside a wwtp or

close to the discharge point of a wwtp these stations

had elevated amounts of nitrate supporting information

si table s which may have altered fungal growth fer 

reira et al 

it is moreover possible that a shift in taxonomic composi 

tion can be accompanied by changes in functionality

 allison and martiny shade et al for exam 

ple the abundant presence of chytridiomycota could result

in different kinds of parasitic or saprotrophic relationships

with the primary producers also present in the mp biofilms 

mediating the carbon nutrient and energy transfer into the

food webs kagami et al agha et al 

in addition fungi could be attracted by organic substances

adsorbed to the plastic surface which form a so called

conditioning surface film donlan in this regard 

several saprotrophic fungi would be able to feed on those

organic substances or on detritus that emerged within the

biofilm including complex molecules wurzbacher et al 

 richards et al 

in contrast to natural biofilms on wood or algal aggre 

gates which will disintegrate over time mp may persist for

years decades or even centuries shah et al 

andrady while carrying its attached biota however 

it is not clear how stable the mp associated microbial com 

munities are some are likely to change along with

changing environmental factors whereas others might

remain more resilient within their micro niches and others

could even switch to resting stages waiting for more favour 

able conditions to reactivate as buoyant mp can be

transported over very long distances barnes law

and thompson mp could facilitate the spread of

fungi to new habitats possibly even at the global scale 

consequently our work raises an additional warning about

the problem of increasing accumulation of plastic contami 

nants in aquatic ecosystems as mp provide selective

advantages for the colonization of certain groups of micro 

organisms but also serve as highly persistent vehicles for

their dispersion as mp introduces huge surfaces for colo 

nization and biofilms are hotspots for microbial activities

 costerton et al further research is necessary to

better elucidate interactions between the microorganisms

on mp their metabolic capabilities and the resulting

impacts on biodiversity food web structures and overall

ecosystem functioning 

conclusions

despite their high phylogenetic diversity and versatile met 

abolic potentials fungi gained very little attention in

previous studies on mp colonization here we provide a

first in depth report about fungal taxa that occurred on mp

in different aquatic ecosystems we observed that location

and substrate type significantly influenced fungal commu 

nity compositions fungal communities on mp differed

from those in water and on the natural substrate wood 

the ecological consequences of selected microbial com 

munities on mp however remain largely unknown though

the diverse and abundant occurrence of fungi on plastic

points towards their high relevance on this artificial habitat 

fungi – as parasites pathogens symbionts or saprobes –

could substantially influence community dynamics and

cycling processes within mp biofilms our findings can

now serve as a basis for future studies aimed at unveiling

ecological functions by targeting more specific fungal

groups of interest such as algal parasites or potential plas 

tic degraders

after extracting the fungal reads from the data set two

approaches were chosen for data evaluation as explained

below and they are herein called ‘taxon based approach’ and

‘otu based approach’ otu operational taxonomic unit 
the taxon based approach is based on a data matrix contain 

ing all fungal taxa and their read abundances per sample 

fungal taxa were named according to the silva taxonomy

 yilmaz et al and often resolved down to the genus

level in case fungal taxa could not be classified on genus

level they were named after the next higher classified taxo 

nomic level family order class subphylum phylum or

kingdom this imbalanced taxonomic resolution can cause

skewed results when comparing community composition and

diversity among samples to overcome this potential bias 

operational taxonomic units otus were calculated at first 

the taxonomic information from the classified fungi is used to

split the dataset into distinct taxonomy groups here on genus

level then otus were clustered within these groups by

applying a distance threshold this ‘otu based approach’

improves the comparability of samples by generating a more

consistent taxonomic resolution detailed methods and

rarefaction curves fig s are presented in supporting

core team including the r package vegan oksanen

et al all samples were assigned to the correspond 

ing substrate type polyethylene polystyrene wood or water

the number of fungal reads by the number of eukaryotic reads
