 introduction 

microbial diversity on earth is extraordinary and soils alone harbor thousands of species per gram hughes et al 

understanding how this diversity is sorted and selected into habitat niches is a major focus of ecology and biotechnology 

but remains only vaguely understood the advent of next generation sequencing technologies now allow for the potential 

to make great leaps in the study of microbe habitat relationships of highly diverse microbial communities and environ 

ments the identity and functions of this overwhelming multitude of microbes are in the beginning stages of being de 

scribed and are already providing insights into microbial impacts on plant and animal health berg evans and 

schwarz clemente et al making use of the overwhelming amount of information on microbial taxa and 

habitats has enormous potential for use to further understand microbial habitat relationships thus the advent of new 

methods and approaches to utilize this data and describe microbiomes will benefit microbial ecology and biotechnology 

though variations exist a core microbiome can be defined conceptually using venn diagrams where over lapping 

circles and non overlapping areas of circles represent shared and non shared members of a habitat respectively shade 

and handelsman typically microbiomes identified in this manner are not statistically evaluated or by nature 

seek to answer specific hypothesis that are specific to an experiment for example studies often identify microbes asso 

ciated with different plant growth stages species cultivars and locations but rarely if at all mine databases or perform 

meta analysis to statistically identify microbiomes across studies and experimental conditions chaudhary et al 

liang et al mao et al mao et al hargreaves et al rodrigues et al jesus et al 

rodrigues et al describing differences due to treatment or habitat conditions are informative in their own right 

however extending this framework to include an easy to use and statistically robust tool to help in the mining of data 

from underutilized and burgeoning databases e g the national center for biotechnology information ncbi riboso

root zone associated core microbiome 

 
 

 

mal database project can help transform the ecological study of microbes in their natural environment using the vast 

and growing databases of organism and habitat metadata will allow for both the testing and development of hypotheses 

associated with habitat microbe relationships that were not formerly possible 

to address the challenges described above we developed coremic a novel easy to use and freely available web 

tool to identify the “core microbiome” of any well defined habitat e g plant root zone or niche shade and 

handelsman this straightforward approach is a novel and powerful way to complement existing analysis e g 

indicator species analysis isa dufrene and legendre by allowing for the use of data that is now overflowing 

among freely available databases it seeks to determine the core set of microbes core microbiome that are explicitly 

associated with a host system or habitat the ability to identify core microbiomes at this scale has great potential to de 

scribe host microbe interactions and habitat preferences of microbes 

a meta analysis based case study was performed combining diverse sequencing datasets derived from ncbi to test 

for the occurrence of a core microbiome in the rhizosphere root zone of switchgrass switchgrass is a us native peren 

nial grass studied by many researchers and thus has a growing database to mine for genetic information its widespread 

study is likely a result of its bioenergy potential and the capacity of the grass to grow on marginal lands not dedicated to 

crops studies have identified different bacteria found in the root zones of switchgrass jesus et al mao et al 

 chaudhary et al liang et al mao et al bahulikar et al mao et al werling et al 

 hargreaves et al jesus et al rodrigues et al however there has been no integrative study of 

different datasets identifying the core microbiome in switchgrass rhizospheres it is thus proposed to identify host habitat 

relationships as a proof of concept for a core microbiome in this paper we utilize a plant host to define a habitat but the 

oretically any habitat and associated organisms could make use of coremic and its approach to identify a core 

microbiome 

 

 material and methods 

 datasets used in the study 

a diverse set of data composed of samples from two different published datasets and collected from multiple locations 

 jesus et al rodrigues et al were used for this study data were obtained from the ncbi and selected 

based on the availability of the raw s rrna sequence data of root zone bacteria from switchgrass and that for an out 

group of reference native and or other grasses plants

the dataset “jesus ” jesus et al prjeb compared the rhizosphere soil microbial communities asso 

ciated with restored prairie with three grass crops namely corn switchgrass and mixed prairie grasses the grasses were 

grown in fields of michigan and wisconsin and were harvested after two and ten years the v v region of the s 

rrna gene was amplified and sequenced using the roche pyrosequencing in our study we used a total of sam 

ples each from corn switchgrass mixed grasses yrs only and restored prairie grasses grown in wisconsin and 

michigan and sampled after and years switchgrass grown in michigan composed of samples were collected 

following years of plant growth 

the dataset “rodrigues ” rodrigues et al prjna compared the root zone soil microbial commu 

nities associated with switchgrass cultivars “alamo” and “dacotah” the switchgrass were grown in the greenhouse us 

ing soil derived from plots growing switchgrass years near blacksburg va switchgrass rhizosphere bacteria were 

sampled at three different growth stages the v v region of the s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced using 

illumina miseq sequencing in our study we used a total of switchgrass samples for alamo a and dacotah d from 

stages v and e av dv ae de 

overall these datasets served as a diverse resource relevant differences are summarized in figure to compare the 

root zone bacteria and identify core bacteria associated with switchgrass 

 

 sequence data analysis and picking of operational taxonomic units otu 

for the rodrigues dataset the otu table was obtained from previously performed analysis rodrigues et al 

for the jesus dataset quality score and read lengths thresholds were enforced using cutadapt 

 martin and an open reference otu picking enable rev strand match true was performed in qiime v 

 caporaso et al as previously described rodrigues et al rodrigues et al to allow comparison with 

the other dataset briefly uclust edgar was used to cluster reads into otus sequence similarity and assign 

taxonomy against the greengenes reference database version desantis et al mcdonald et al two 

samples from the jesus dataset were removed from downstream analysis due to very few sequences assigned to 

otus 

 

 combining two datasets 

within each otu table sequences assigned to identical otus in a sample were summed to retain unique taxa the 

common otus from the two datasets were selected converted to biom format and used for further analyses figure

 the data table was filtered and rarefied using a sequence threshold of and the beta diversity was calculated us 

ing bray curtis beals distance and visualized using principal coordinate analysis gower multivariate 

data analysis methods of mrpp mielke permanova anderson and anosim clarke were used to 

identify whether the plant type switchgrass versus non switchgrass were associated with different bacterial communi 

ties 

 

 core microbiome analysis 

to find the set of core otus the samples in the combined otu table original data were first divided into the interest 

group samples switchgrass and out group samples the abundance values for each otu in each sample are then con 

verted to binary present absent values based on whether they are zero or nonzero for each otu a one tailed fisher’s 

exact test was used to calculate a p value testing whether an otu was present in a significantly higher portion in the 

interest in group switchgrass compared to the out group samples numerous other grass species 

these p values were corrected for multiple testing using benjamini hochberg the otus with a q value were 

then selected to only the otus that are present in at least of the interest group samples uninformative otus e g 

k bacteria p c o f g s were filtered out and the remaining otus were candidates for the core microbiome 

 

 implementation of coremic

after quality filtering a total of reads were obtained from the jesus dataset mean and std dev 

 two samples with very few and counts were removed each of the remaining samples had more than 

sequences assigned to otus the number of otus in the jesus and rodrigues datasets was and 

respectively the combined dataset had otus switchgrass and non switchgrass other grasses samples 

the bacterial communities in switchgrass and grasses from the combined dataset were significantly different 

 permanova mrpp and anosim p values and as can be observed using the pcoa plot using the bray curtis 

dissimilarity metric figure these differences were apparent despite significant difference across datasets 

 permanova mrpp and anosim p values which could be the result for example of the heterogeneity of the 

data set related to climate soil type condition growth conditions and plant age in this regard at the phylum level mann 

whitney test identified bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia had significantly greater p value relative abundance 

in switchgrass whereas gemmatimonadetes were more abundant in other grasses figure s 

we used a very conservative criterion of threshold i e an otu has to be present in at least of switchgrass 

samples and observed five otus with fdr q values table the relative abundance and a phylogenetic tree 

exhibiting their relationship with the core otus from the non switchgrass samples is shown in figure s and figure s

root zone associated core microbiome 

 
 

 

 

 discussion 

the case study showed how coremic can identify key habitat specific microbes across diverse samples using current 

ly available databases and a unique freely available software the core set of bacteria associated with switchgrass includ 

ed among others closely related taxa from lysobacter spp mesorhizobium spp and chitinophagaceae the functional 

relevance of these bacteria related to switchgrass is unknown but it is notable that these bacteria have been shown to 

produce bacterial and fungal antibiotics and promote the growth of plants kaneko et al kilic ekici and yuen 

 weir et al islam et al jochum et al ji et al park et al nandasena et al 

yin bailey et al degefu et al guerrouj et al madhaiyan et al the analyses from the 

highly diverse data sets thus provided information that helps to greatly narrow down possibilities and thus set the stage 

for testing using controlled studies how the core microbiota potentially support or antagonize the function of a native 

grass this novel toolkit is simple to use and supports use by a broad range of biological scientists and is particularly 

relevant to those with expertise in their field but with limited bioinformatics background overall in a dataset derived 

from a complex and diverse set of habitats and ecosystems this tool was shown to pinpoint microbiota of the microbiome 

that might have important functional implications within their habitat or host 

 

 methodological considerations in the use of coremic 

coremic performs a complementary analysis different from that of existing methods by using presence absence data 

for two groups a and b it checks whether pre determined percentage of samples from group a have a non zero value 

for the otu this allows scientists to operate without making assumptions about the pcr based otu relative abundanc 

es this is considered a potential advantage of the method because it is unknown whether relative abundance of sequence 

data is representative of true relative differences between communities further research in this regard will be aimed 

towards investigating other measures of otu “presence” namely the extent of exclusivity consistency or abundance of 

the group that is eventually determined to be a core microbiome 

sampling plots used in this study were located across a range of diverse environments to help create a backdrop of het 

erogeneity while this diversity of habitat conditions ignores the potential for microbe environment interactions that 

might be important for the plant microbial relationship it has the advantage of being a conservative approach with high 

veracity for defining a core microbiome regardless of habitat heterogeneity the locations from which samples were 

grown michigan wisconsin virginia were treated as independent to help isolate the overall habitat effect of

switchgrass werling et al jesus et al when the effects of habitat are thought to be habitat specific re 

searchers can take this into account during the design and analysis using coremic 

it is notable that the representation of an outgroup multiple non switchgrass species is an important criteria and 

choice made by researchers and is an approach that has both advantages and caveats by definition a habitat is defined 

by its differences from that of other habitats and therefore the use of the outgroup is an important choice a counter 

argument for the current dataset might argue for exclusion of breeding lines of a cultivated grass maize as being unrep 

resentative of the grass outgroup in our case it was thought a priori that a diverse set of grasses would provide the best 

comparison and no compelling argument was found that supported the exclusion of maize from the analysis an implicit 

assumption was also made that the taxonomy of plant species root zone habitats play an important role in determining 

root zone microbial communities an approach supported by extensive findings that different grass species associate with 

different microbial communities kuske et al kennedy et al berendsen et al chaudhary et al 

 turner et al so although there is a need for careful consideration of the experimental questions of interest 

when using coremic this is a common if not ubiquitous foundation of all experimentation and hypothesis testing the 

results provide a statistically valid approach using freely available software to describe and define a core microbiome of 

switchgrass 

the choice of the outgroup furthermore for determining a core microbiome is amenable to choice using deductive rea 

soning but ultimately limited by available data this issue almost certainly limits inclusion of many functionally im 

portant rhizosphere microbes that could affect the growth of switchgrass in this study the proof of concept utilized a 

conservative approach to highlight the methodology across a diversity of geographies soil types and plant ages the 

coremic tool as well as the multiple methods for defining a core microbiome e g qiime caporaso et al 

isa dufrene and legendre will always be defined by the expertise and the nature of the hypotheses defined and 

defended by individual researchers 

 

 core microbes 

the individual datasets described in this study had previously focused on identifying abundant microbes and differences 

due to experimental conditions the current meta analysis goes a step further to find common microbiota that are associ 

ated with switchgrass across the diverse experimental conditions the members of the lysobacter genus an identified 

core microbe of switchgrass are known to live in soil and have been shown to be ecologically important due to their abil 

ity to produce exo enzymes and antibiotics reichenbach their antimicrobial activities against bacteria fungi

unicellular algae and nematodes have been described islam et al jochum et al park et al yin 

 strains of this genus for example have been used for control of diseases caused by bacteria in rice ji et al 

and tall fescue kilic ekici and yuen reports of their function thus support the idea that they may play an im 

portant role in switchgrass growth and survival the core microbiome results thus support further research into the role 

played by this bacterium in the switchgrass rhizosphere 

similarly members of the mesorhizobium genus are well known diazotrophs kaneko et al and previously 

shown to be symbiotically associated with switchgrass deangelis et al bahulikar et al and legumes weir 

et al nandasena et al degefu et al guerrouj et al another identified core microbiome taxa 

soil dwelling members of the chitinophagaceae family are known to have β glucosidase bailey et al and 

aminocyclopropane carboxylate acc deaminase activities and ability to produce indole acetic acid iaa 

 madhaiyan et al these molecules and enzymes are well known for their effects on plant growth zhao 

van de poel and van der straeten the capacity to degrade cellulose might provide additional and readily availa 

ble options to aid survival of these bacteria near switchgrass root zones during times of environmental stress acc 

deaminase and iaa production in contrast are potent plant growth modulators glick that could play a role in 

plant productivity and survival especially under conditions of plant physiological stress though these examples above 

would need further study they provide consistent examples describing how a core microorganism could play a role in 

determining plant function and growth the power of the approach stems from the ability to identify the core microbes 

associated with a plant or other habitat and that can with veracity narrow down potentially important core microbes 

from otherwise hyperdiverse samples 

from a technological standpoint it is important to put the current approach into context with research before the 

metagenomics era the search and identification of antagonistic plant growth promoting microbes has previously been 

tedious and labor intensive screenings of hundreds of microbes were used to cultivate and identify candidate microbes 

that might support or deter plant growth in the case of beneficial microbes even when identified under greenhouse 

conditions the beneficial effects rarely translated into plant supportive growth under field growth conditions babalola 

 hayat et al with the aid of hindsight and new knowledge suggesting the importance of the soil habitat and 

root soil interactions in the development of growth promoting plant microbial relationships the approach used in this 

study reverses the focus from top down to bottom up to search for microbes that appear to already be naturally well 

adapted to the root soil habitats of interest trabelsi and mhamdi souza et al this process streamlines the 

search for suitable microbes from a daunting pool of thousands of bacterial taxa bacteria and fungi with well known

partnerships with members of the core microbiome it would be expected to be more readily adaptable to their native 

environment indeed the concept of adaptability to an environment has been shown to be true for many types of microbes 

across the environmental spectrum and has given rise to the concept of the niche lennon et al the coremic 

tool provides an alternative and logical approach to help mine available datasets in the search for core microbiomes as 

sociated with habitats that are ecologically and agriculturally important 

 

 conclusions 

the coremic tool by helping to mine multiple datasets fills a major gap in the search for the core microbiome associ 

ated with a host or habitat it allows for the development of a working hypothesis in the search for microbes well suited 

for a habitat or host microbe interaction it can also be used to confirm laboratory studies that have identified target mi 

crobes that might be important symbionts or thought to be associated with a specific habitat in the case of plants but not 

limited to them the coremic approach can identify microbial targets that might be useful for plant growth promotion 

an example of this would be the identification of diazotrophic bacteria that aid the growth of bioenergy grasses and help 

to serve the development of sustainable agricultural systems this combined with the ongoing efforts of plant breeding 

and genetic modification would help to catalyze microbe driven crop yield improvement while practicing environmental 

stewardship through reduced fertilizer use here we show the applicability of coremic in rhizosphere associated mi 

crobes but the overall concepts are translational across disciplines with interests in host microbe and microbe habitat 

relationships the applicability of coremic for the identification of core genes and microbes has excellent potential to 

help understand the roles of microorganisms in complex and diverse microbial communities
