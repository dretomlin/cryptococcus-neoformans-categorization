as rice yield is enormously affected by large number of pathogenic
organisms nematodes fungi insects and virus hence understanding
kolkata – 

s an open access article under
and exploitation of the root endophytic community for this high
demand asian crop can result in the promotion of crop health this
could be an alternative approach towards eco friendly potential natural
source for biological control in disease management advances in
high throughput environmental genomic dna sequencing or meta 
genomic sequencing as well as various analytical tools and data re 
sources has enabled us to understand the vast diversity of
microorganisms specially rare and uncultured microorganism and
their phylogeny in community analysis it also gives us insight into the
enormous amount of functional gene diversity of a microenvironment
 the low cost of this technology and easy generation of draft ge 
nomes from complex dataset has made metagenomics study a much
popular technique bypassing the need for isolation and lab cultivation
of individual microorganism 

in this study we thoroughly investigated the root endophyticmicro 
bial community present in the local cultivar of rice oryza sativa l at
different field condition of west bengal the rice plants were selected
at days stage and were dug out from some selected wet land local
ricefieldswhich produces the bulk of the requirement of the population
of kolkata average temp of the area was °f and soil ph ranges from
ph to ph 

among collected samples two samples os andos were ran 
domly selected for metagenomic sequencing the total number of reads
obtained for sample os was and that for sample os was
 fig in both the samples the community study revealed
an abundance of over for the members of firmicutes in sample
os the percentage was found to be while in sample os it
was at the genus level bacillus was the most dominant microbial

 materials and methods

samples were collected directly from field in and around kolkata in
triplicates and were stored in sterile plastic bags root samples were
thoroughly washed in tap water several times surface sterilization of
the root tips were then performed with ethanol for min followed
by w v naocl solution for min samples were then washed
three times with sterile distilled water with shaking min root
samples were finally dried and stored at− °c the dna of each sam 
ple was isolated according to the protocol reported by bonet et al 
 the dna was quantified using qubitdsdna hs assay kit life tech 
 μl of each sample was used for determining concentration using
qubit® fluorometer the amplicon libraries were prepared using
nextera xt index kit illuminainc as per the s metagenomic se 
quencing library preparation protocol part rev b

primers for the amplification of the v v hyper variable region v 
forward oligo cctacgggnbgcascag and v reverse oligo 
gactacnvgggtatctaatcc of s rdna gene of bacteria andarchaea
were used the ampliconswith the illumina adaptors were amplified by
using i and i primers that addmultiplexing index sequences aswell as
common adapters required for cluster generation p and p as per the
standard illumina protocol the amplicon libraries were purified by ×
ampurexp beads and checked on agilent dna chip on bioanalyzer
 and quantified on fluorometer by qubitdsdna hs assay kit life
technologies the library size of sample os and sample os were
 bp and bp respectively the libraries were sequenced using
the illumina sequencing chemistry to generate mb of data per
sample after obtaining the qubit concentration for the library and the
mean peak size from bioanalyzer profile library was loaded onto
illumina platform at appropriate concentration – pm for cluster
generation and sequencing the kit reagents were used in binding of
samples to complementary adapter oligos on paired end flow cell the
adapters were designed to allow selective cleavage of the forward
strands after re synthesis of the reverse strand during sequencing the
copied reverse strand was then used to perform sequencing from the
opposite end of the fragments 

 verification and authentication

our study revealed that in both the samples the dominant member
of rice root microbiome is bacillus and this data is well supported by
other literatures qiime analysis indicated that shannonα diversi 
ty and no of observed species and the shannonα diver 
sity and no of observed species for sample os and for
sample os respectively at phylum level both the samples are
enriched with firmicutes followed by proteobacteria bacilli whereas
gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant at class level in both
the samples at genus level bacillus and acinetobacter were found to
be the most abundant genus enriched in both the root samples more 
over our findings were also consistent with the reports of ji et al 
 where three major diazotrophic endophytic communities
were identified as actinobacteria gammaproteobacteria and bacillus 
although the functional annotations of the endophytic bacterial com 
munity of our samples are still pending however the dominant groups
suggests their probable role of atmospheric n fixation a primary requi 
site for plant growth particularly in rice
