abstract

zooplankton dominate the abundance and biomass of multicellular animals in pelagic marine environ 

ments however traditional methods to characterize zooplankton communities are invasive and laborious 

this study compares zooplankton taxonomic composition revealed through metabarcoding of the cyto 

chrome oxidase i coi and s rrna genes to traditional morphological identification by microscopy trip 

licates of three different sample types were collected from three coral reef sites in the florida keys national

marine sanctuary l surface seawater samples prefiltered through lm filters and subsequently collected
on lm filters for edna pf edna l surface seawater samples filtered on lm pore size filters
 environmental dna edna and zooplankton tissue samples from lm lm and lm mesh
size net tows the zooplankton tissue samples were split with half identified morphologically and tissue

dna t dna extracted from the other half the coi and s rrna gene metabarcoding of pf edna edna 

and t dna samples was performed using illumina miseq of the families detected with coi and s rrna

gene metabarcoding and respectively were also identified through morphological assessments 

significant differences in taxonomic composition were observed between pf dna edna and t dna with

both genetic markers pf edna resulted in detection of fewer taxa than the other two sample types thus 

prefiltering is not recommended all dominant copepod taxa of total abundance were detected

with edna t dna and morphological assessments demonstrating that edna metabarcoding is a promising

technique for future biodiversity assessments of pelagic zooplankton in marine systems 

an essential element of environmental conservation and

monitoring programs is biodiversity assessment including

describing community taxonomic composition at different

trophic levels lodge et al traditional methods that

characterize biodiversity are laborious i e visual surveys and

can be environmentally destructive e g trawling wheeler

et al wheeler and valdecasas genetic analysis of

environmental dna edna which contains dna shed by

organisms present in a given environment offers a high 

throughput cheaper more sensitive and less destructive

method for characterizing biodiversity davy et al flynn

et al harvey et al the estimation of biodiversity

from metabarcoding pcr and next generation sequencing of

conserved genetic markers has become standard practice in

the field of microbial ecology rusch et al caporaso

et al for multicellular organisms the application of

specific genetic assays to edna is frequently used for the detec

barcoding of edna is becoming increasingly applied for

determining taxonomic composition of higher trophic levels

in aquatic and terrestrial environments aylagas et al 

kelly et al port et al valentini et al kelly

et al such studies complement traditional surveys and

frequently lead to the identification of organisms not com 

monly detected using visual techniques kelly et al olds

metabarcoding offers a practical means for assessing biodi 

versity over time from tropical to polar ecosystems and at

multiple trophic levels to inform policy and management

across local regional national and international scales 

to achieve this mbon vision we tested the effectiveness

of edna metabarcoding for determining zooplankton taxo 

nomic composition and monitoring community responses

to environmental change previous studies have performed

metabarcoding of cytochrome oxidase i coi and s rrna

genes on zooplankton community tissues t dna i e net

of sequences recovered for particular taxa lindeque et al 

 harvey et al however noninvasive methods

for assessing biodiversity particularly metabarcoding of

edna collected from surface water samples have not previ 

ously been tested for pelagic zooplankton communities 

here we assess the taxonomic composition of the zoo 

plankton community at three coral reef sites within the flor

edna and t dna with two genetic loci coi and s com 

pared to traditional microscopy surveys morphological iden 

tification this study is the first to our knowledge to

compare edna metabarcoding data for pelagic marine zoo 

plankton taxa with morphological taxonomic data for net

vey et al we hypothesized that the patterns of mor 

phological zooplankton taxonomic composition from net

tows would be most similar to results obtained with t dna

metabarcoding additionally we tested the impact of apply 

ing a prefiltering step to the collection of edna to reduce

biases associated with capturing whole animals this work

lays the foundation for applying edna metabarcoding to

marine pelagic zooplankton communities and provides

 no chordate sequences were observed among the

 s rrna sequences 

paracalanus was not detected with the s rrna gene 

and oithona was not detected with coi thus they could

not be compared to biomass using those markers in some

sequence abundances although these relationships were

never statistically significant supporting information fig

available for the copepod genera paracalanus and oithona 

the copepod order harpacticoida and gastropoda kelble

discussion

molecular taxonomy

metabarcoding with next generation sequencing is well

suited for large scale biodiversity analyses shokralla et al 

 this technique has been successfully used to describe

the diversity of mixed zooplankton tissue samples for the

 s rrna coi and s rrna genetic loci lindeque et al 

 harvey et al our results show similar richness

estimates for s rrna and coi sequencing data from

similarly treated samples i e pf edna edna and t dna 

 fig 

significantly higher total otu richness was recovered

from edna than from the t dna this is likely due to the

diversity of organisms in the ambient waters not captured by

net tows while t dna will only capture plankton within

the path of the net tow the edna samples will capture dna

from both benthic and pelagic sessile and motile animals 

thus increasing the diversity in those samples 

to avoid biasing our sequence outcome by catching

whole animals i e copepods or nauplii on the lm fil 
ters used for collecting edna one treatment pf edna 

involved pre filtering the edna samples through a lm fil 
ter the lm pre filter was chosen based on standards in
microbial and chemical oceanography where a lm filter is
frequently used to separate particle associated vs free living

microorganisms michaud et al this prefiltration step

resulted in reduced sequence recovery reduced richness and

a bias in estimated taxonomic composition fig c since

fig venn diagram of copepod genera detected using genetic markers in tissue dna t dna left environmental dna edna right and mor 
phological assessments bottom nearly all dominant red of total abundance copepod genera were identified by each treatment type 

djurhuus et al metabarcoding zooplankton from edna

 



edna is estimated to range in size between lm to lm
 turner et al it is likely that the lm filter retained
relevant genetic material we therefore recommend against

pre filtering however future studies could evaluate the

effect of pre filtering with a pore size greater than lm to
ensure removal of animal specimens with minimal edna

removal 

the three molecular treatments i e pf edna edna and

t dna yielded significantly different taxonomic composi 

tions with triplicates grouping closely together with each

other on the nmds fig although the triplicates for each

treatment were similar we did encounter examples where

taxa were only detected in one of the triplicates thus tripli 

cate samples allowed detection of more taxa and gave higher

confidence in the results due to increased statistical power in

the analyses 

for the coi edna sequences annotated to genera fig 

table the total richness was significantly lower than for

 s rrna edna sequences this raised the question of data 

base choice for sequence comparisons of different genetic

loci the silva database pruesse et al is superior for

annotating s rrna sequences to finer taxonomic levels

than the ncbi nt database lindeque et al however 

since coi sequences are not included in the silva database 

this study annotated all sequences using the ncbi database

to allow comparison of diversity and taxonomy between the

two loci the ncbi nt database consists of an annotated col 

lection of all publicly available dna sequences and is popu 

lated by both full and partial dna sequences benson et al 

 the difference between richness of s rrna and coi

sequences annotated to genera from edna is most likely due

to fewer reference sequences available for coi than for s

rrna it is also possible that the intraspecific variability

within this portion of the coi gene is relatively high this

would result in a higher otu richness than that seen

amongst the annotated sequences as multiple otus may

cluster together into a single genus such as has been shown

previously for diptera meier et al 

although the ncbi nt database offers the convenience of

comparing multiple loci against an identical database better

taxonomic assignments will likely be achieved through com 

parisons to specialized databases such as silva for s rrna

and bold for coi sequences min and hickey linde 

que et al regardless of the specific database used the

taxonomic assignment of otus may be biased or hindered

by a lack of reference sequences as was the case for the

copepod genus microsetella in this study it will be impossible

to identify some taxa observed by microscopy if their

sequences are not present in the databases additionally 

submission of sequences to some databases including ncbi 

does not require voucher specimens to prove species identifi 

cation which could lead to incorrect or ambiguous annota 

tions we caution that until the databases are better

populated care must be taken with interpretation of

sequence comparison results especially with respect to rare

or unexpected species 

morphological taxonomy

the most common holoplankton in florida bay are the

copepod genera paracalanus oithona and acartia kelble

et al however in march samples acartia were

not observed in the morphological assessments performed

by microscopy both genetic markers detected acartia in

both edna and t dna samples however never in signifi 

cant abundances a few copepods from the genus acartia

were found by microscopy in the same locations during

other seasons but never more than individuals this

genus may be rare and very patchy or more actively avoids

nets than other copepods kaartvedt et al database

limitations and misidentification of sequences submitted to

the database could also yield false positives from the

sequencing data and lead to a lower or higher sequence

abundance of any copepod genus the sequencing methods

can identify all life stages of organisms while microscopy

can generally only identify adults therefore the detection of

sequences from early life stages eggs or nauplii could

explain the detection of copepod sequences in the absence

of identifiable adults under the microscope 

comparison of molecular and morphological taxonomy

morphological and molecular techniques both detected a

large variety of taxa supporting information fig s the

edna samples detected a larger diversity of organisms than

the t dna or microscopy biodiversity observations from

edna are not biased by sampling method e g different

mesh sizes net avoidance or destruction of gelatinous ani 

mals yet these edna methods are sensitive to other biases 

such as the integrity of dna exposed to temperature fluctua 

tions bacterial activity variation in dna residence time uv

exposure or differences in dna shedding rates by different

organisms t dna performed better than edna at detecting

the copepod genera identified in microscopy analyses thus 

t dna reflected more closely what was detected by micros 

copy of the net samples likely because the t dna and

microscopy methods share the same net biases and originate

from the same pool of animals in contrast edna metabar 

coding was superior for detecting organisms other than

copepods while still recovering most of the dominant cope 

pod taxa fig and thus edna metabarcoding provides

different insights into biodiversity of the zooplankton 

therefore while t dna is more likely to correspond slightly

better with traditional morphological analyses this study

suggests that edna is a suitable technique for assessing the

overall diversity of zooplankton communities in addition 

edna data from s rrna seems to reflect a more similar

relative abundance of taxa similar to that of morphological

analysis 

we propose that differences in total abundance from mor 

phological vs metabarcoding assessments are due to

djurhuus et al metabarcoding zooplankton from edna

 



differences in the total biomass sampled by each technique 

morphological analyses measure numerical abundance of

organisms including their life stages whereas metabarcoding

analysis is more closely related to biomass and does not yield

any information on life stages the relationship between bio 

mass and number of sequences is not linear since sequence

generation is subject to biases that can be introduced at a

number of different steps during sample processing such as

dna extraction pcr and bioinformatic classification bik

et al in addition a high gene copy number for differ 

ent taxa or markers could inflate the sequence abundance

relative to biomass klappenbach et al 

the most abundant copepod genera identified by micros 

copy were all detected by edna and t dna with the excep 

tion of euterpina and labidocera fig this shows that

both edna and t dna metabarcoding will detect the domi 

nant copepod genera of the community with edna being

the easiest and least invasive sample collection analysis

method with the fewest opportunities for human error in

terms of the relative abundance of copepods maxillopoda 

the t dna sequences reflect the morphological assessment

slightly better than edna globally most copepod commu 

nities are dominated by a few genera e g calanus acartia 

oithona clausocalanus paracalanus and pseudocalanus 

which were all detected in this study making edna an

applicable method for analysis of dominant copepod com 

munities from other locations as well as for the florida keys 

the two genetic loci analyzed in this study complement

each other resulting in the identification of different taxa 

since each primer set has different associated biases per 

forming metabarcoding of multiple genetic loci will maxi 

mize the recovery of ecosystem biodiversity additional

markers e g s rrna gene as seen in harvey et al 

would most likely yield additional taxa which could

increase the diversity of recovered sequences 

a few copepod groups euterpina pontella sapphirinidae 

and temora were initially detected only through sequencing

and not observed by morphology further targeted searches

enabled their subsequent morphological identification

through re analysis of total as opposed to split samples

 figs subsampling using the folsom splitter of the

zooplankton for morphological analysis results in removal of

some of the more rare taxa this may not be the case with

sequencing as some trace genetic material of all organisms

will likely be present in all sub samples with recovery more

dependent on sequencing depth combining techniques

 sequencing of t dna and microscopy resulted in identifica 

tion of the largest number of copepod genera and would be

recommended for a thorough assessment of copepod diver 

sity in marine systems 

each of the different sampling methods and identification

techniques yielded somewhat different taxonomic composi 

tion of the zooplankton communities using edna for the

detection of dominant taxa of zooplankton communities in

marine systems is promising especially when combining

two or more different genetic loci therefore each locus or

method used represents a different “window” through which

to view biodiversity each method complements the others 

and using several different methods could yield a more com 

plete picture of the biosphere our results indicate that

sequencing the tissue from net tows yields the highest diver 

sity of copepods although this method can be affected by

limitations of databases and net avoidance by organisms it

reduces the time and human error of microscope counts 

diversity analyses performed using edna have the advan 

tage of easier and less invasive sample collection plus the

ability to recover species not captured through net tows 

therefore edna metabarcoding provides complementary

insights into zooplankton biodiversity metabarcoding of

either tissues or edna will become progressively more accu 

rate for estimating diversity as genetic databases become

more taxonomically enriched over time
