the fungal kingdom is replete with unique adaptive capacities that allow fungi to colonize a wide variety of habitats ranging
from marine habitats to freshwater and terrestrial habitats the diversity importance and ecological roles of marine fungi have
recently been highlighted in deep subsurface sediments using molecular methods fungi in the deep marine subsurface may be
specifically adapted to life in the deep biosphere but this can be demonstrated only using culture based analyses in this study 
we investigated culturable fungal communities from a record depth sediment core sampled from the canterbury basin new
zealand with the aim to reveal endemic or ubiquist adapted isolates playing a significant ecological role s about filamen 
tous fungi and yeasts were isolated fungal isolates were affiliated with the phyla ascomycota and basidiomycota 
including genera screening for genes involved in secondary metabolite synthesis also revealed their bioactive compound syn 
thesis potential our results provide evidence that deep subsurface fungal communities are able to survive adapt grow and in 
teract with other microbial communities and highlight that the deep sediment habitat is another ecological niche for fungi 

marine environments encompass coastal and open ocean wa ter columns and sediments including the deep marine sub 
surface these environments harbor a broad diversity of microor 
ganisms involved in biogeochemical cycling there has recently
been increasing interest in the diversity of microbial eukaryotes in
these habitats particularly in the subsurface biosphere hydro 
thermal vent sediments – as well as sediments from centime 
ters to hundreds of meters below the seafloor – have been
investigated using both molecular and culture dependent meth 
ods such integrated approaches have revealed the occurrence and
activity of complex fungal communities in these extreme environ 
ments fungal dna and rna signatures as well as cultured iso 
lates provide direct evidence that fungi persist in these marine
sediments although their role in these ecosystems is not yet clearly
understood most of the fungal molecular signatures and cultured
isolates from those habitats were affiliated with the phylum asco 
mycota and a few of them belonged to the phyla basidiomycota
and chytridiomycota while some fungal sequences are from
potentially novel organisms many sequences are from fungi with
close relatives from terrestrial freshwater and marine environ 
ments 

to date within subseafloor sediments fungi have been identi 
fied from a few centimeters below the seafloor down to 
m below the seafloor mbsf but we are still eager to assess
whether they persist only as vegetative spores or play an active
role s in biogeochemical cycling recent metatranscriptomic
analyses suggest that fungi while occurring in lower abundance
than bacteria and archaea possess the ability to degrade a variety
of organic substrates in deep subseafloor sediments 

limitations on habitability in deep subseafloor sediments are
set by a variety of physical and chemical properties acting both
individually and in combination including low nutrient availabil 
ity salinity hydrostatic and lithostatic pressures ph porosity 
and temperature the deep subsurface is defined by microbial
ecologists as sediment layers with distinct microbial communities
that lack the microbial imprint of water column communities
 as many molecular signatures representing terrestrial fungi
have been detected in deep marine subsurface sediments it is now

necessary to determine whether such terrestrial microorganisms
occurring in this ecosystem are specifically adapted to the extreme
in situ conditions 

microbial interactions between fungi bacteria and archaea
may occur in subsurface sediments including those resulting
from the synthesis and release of bioactive compounds from an 
timicrobials to cell cycle blockers marine fungi from coastal waters
are known to synthesize a broad range of bioactive natural com 
pounds with interesting bioactivities including polyketides 
peptides alkaloids and terpenoids consequently the deep sub 
seafloor may be an untapped reservoir of microorganisms pro 
ducing biomolecules that may be useful for biotechnological ap 
plications 

here we present the first culture based analysis of fungi iso 
lated from deep subsurface sediments the purpose of this survey
was i to determine the distribution pattern of culturable fungal
communities along a sediment core from the canterbury basin
near new zealand ii to characterize their ecophysiological pro 
files and consequently to assess their ability to withstand harsh in
situ conditions that include elevated hydrostatic pressure high
salinity and a range of temperatures and iii to evaluate their
genetic potential for the synthesis of bioactive compounds

materials and methods
site description and sediment sampling sediment samples were ob 
tained from a core collected in the canterbury basin on the eastern mar 
gin of the south island of new zealand at site u ° �s 
 ° �e this core reached a depth of mbsf and was drilled
during the integrated ocean drilling program iodp leg expedi 
tion on ds joides resolution in a water depth of m fluorescent
microspheres were used as tracers for contamination during drilling 
samples were processed under strict contamination control conditions
onboard and onshore and only samples with undetectable contamination
were used for this study core subsampling was performed onboard
under sterile conditions and only the center parts of unconsolidated sed 
iments and intact pieces of rocks were kept for microbiological analyses as
reported elsewhere subsamples were immediately transferred into a
sterile schott bottle sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and were stored at
 °c under a nitrogen atmosphere for later cultivation a recent culture 
independent study of the same core did not detect contamination of those
sediment samples for this study samples of sediment and
sedimentary rock collected at depths ranging from to mbsf were
analyzed table

 of yielded fungal isolates fig under the expected
in situ hydrostatic pressures syringe cultures were processed
per sample with different conditions varying by temperature 
temperature per sample according to the expected in situ temper 
ature salinity and and nutrients different media 
with and without antibiotics being tested each combination of
conditions was tested in duplicate under atmospheric pressure 
 petri dishes were processed per sample with different condi 
tions varying by temperature temperatures per sample accord 
ing to the expected in situ temperature salinity and and
nutrients different media with and without antibiotics being
tested in duplicate the final number of fungal isolates obtained
was and their distribution across the sediment core is shown
in table the greatest number of isolates was obtained from
sediments at and mbsf and from sediments at to mbsf 
only one isolate was obtained from the deepest layers between
 and mbsf the sedimentary rock fig results were
analyzed using two way analysis of variance anova to assess
the effect of depth on isolation abundance the effect of depth was
highly significant f � p � the shannon index 
which is a well known parameter used to express the diversity of
communities was calculated for each depth and corroborates
these findings showing that the sample from mbsf produced
the most diverse culture collection thus sediment depth clearly
influenced the isolation rate and confirms that culturable fungi are
present primarily at specific depths along the core additionally it
was more difficult to obtain positive cultures of samples from
deeper layers indeed only one isolate was obtained from 
mbsf and no fungus was ever isolated from a sample from 
mbsf this strong statistical evidence for the uniqueness of com 
munities at different depths supports the idea that our isolates
were not contaminants 

morphological characteristics allowed us to separate filamen 
tous fungal forms from unicellular yeasts observations revealed
branching hyphae and spores for filamentous fungi isolates 
and budding cells for yeasts isolates eighty six isolates were
obtained on culture media amended with sea salts and

used similarity clusters to generate two dendrograms one for fil 
amentous fungi and one for yeasts using this strategy clusters 
 for filamentous fungi and for yeasts were established as
shown in fig s and s in the supplemental material the minor
fingerprint variability found within msp pcr clusters was de 
fined as intraspecific heterogeneity several representatives from
each cluster were selected for identification using ssu its and

subsurface sediments different filamentous fungal isolates that
were from the same cluster on the basis of the s rrna its and
 s rrna gene sequences but that were obtained from different
depths were selected fusarium spp from to mbsf pen 
icillium spp from to mbsf paecilomyces spp from to 
mbsf exophiala spp from to mbsf and acremonium sp 
at mbsf maximum specific growth rates �max were calculated
for each isolate under all sets of conditions temperatures and 
salinities 

most of the isolates were determined to be nonhalophiles for
which the maximal growth rate was observed in the absence of sea
salts and decreasing growth rates were observed with increasing
concentrations of sea salts in the media or halotolerant in which
the isolates were able to grow in the absence as well as in the
presence of sea salts at °c and °c fig no useful infor 
mation was obtained from incubations at °c as most of the
isolates were still in lag phase after h only one fusarium sp 
collected at mbsf was able to grow at °c in less than h and
this organism displayed the same general trend at °c as it did at
 °c 

isolates affiliated with fusarium spp were defined as nonhalo 

philes at and °c regardless of the depth from which the
sample was obtained isolates affiliated with penicillium spp were
defined as halotolerant at °c with better growth being observed
in the presence of sea salts isolates affiliated with paecilomyces
spp exophiala spp and acremonium spp displayed the same
nonhalophilic pattern at °c interestingly at °c these isolates
were halotolerant and even halophilic in the case of the deepest
exophiala spp and acremonium spp this ecophysiological shift
was clearly observed at °c where all isolates selected for
ecophysiological characterization were defined as halophiles or
halotolerant in the case of the paecilomyces spp from mbsf 
this shift toward halophily was much more significant for peni 
cillium spp recovered from deeper sediments and mbsf 

different yeasts from the same cluster but from different sam 
pling depths were also selected for ecophysiological analysis us 
ing the same methodology their maximum specific growth rates
at one temperature °c and salinities were calculated all
isolates affiliated with rhodotorula spp n � were defined as
nonhalophiles indeed growth rates decreased when the sea salt
concentration increased isolates affiliated with meyerozyma spp 
were much more diverse on the basis of their responses isolates

was evident for yeasts but filamentous fungal isolates from deeper
layers seemed to harbor fewer genes for bioactive compounds
than isolates from shallower depths 

discussion

the aim of this study was to assess deep marine subsurface sedi 
ments for the presence of culturable fungi and to determine their
genetic potential for bioactive compound synthesis we examined
subsurface sediments collected from the canterbury basin at 
depths ranging from mbsf to mbsf the culture collection
of filamentous fungi and yeasts obtained provides insights into the
culturable fraction of in situ fungal communities colonizing the
subseafloor at this site 

controlling contamination the potential for microbiologi 
cal contamination of samples was monitored carefully during the

iodp leg expedition and during subsequent laboratory pro 
cedures described above the sampling procedures and contam 
ination controls used during this expedition have been previously
described one of our samples from mbsf did not
produce cultivable fungi fig in spite of the fact that the same
methods were applied for sampling and organism isolation by
culture for samples from all depths although we cannot defini 
tively rule out the possibility that one or more of our cultured
isolates represents a contaminant the fact that one of our samples
did not produce cultivable fungi is further support for the absence
of contamination during our sampling and culturing efforts our
anova analysis and shannon diversity indices also clearly indi 
cate that the distribution of our isolates was dependent on the
sampling depth this strongly supports the idea that the recovered
fungi were not contaminants the high rate of recovery of fungal

conditions further indicates that these fungi are able to grow un

distribution pattern of fungal communities the phyloge 
netic diversity of fungi revealed in this study is relatively low com 
pared to that in well characterized organic matter rich terrestrial
or marine habitats i e soils plants mangroves etc despite
that fact there was a greater diversity from the upper sediment
layers down to mbsf with different species representing
more than of the whole diversity within our fungal culture
collection being recovered in samples from greater depths from
 to mbsf only different species representing about
 of the recovered diversity were observed in our culture col 
lection fig this could be explained by a reduction in accessi 
ble organic matter with depth indeed the organic matter quality
changed from relatively labile material in shallow sediments to
more stable protokerogen at greater sediment depths among
the species recovered in our cultures some were isolated from
a unique depth and several species were shared between or more
depths the highest rate of occurrence of a species along the core
was reported for rhodotorula mucilaginosa isolated at depths
ranging from to mbsf a maximal overlap between depths
was observed for samples from and mbsf with shared
species i e an acremonium sp cladophialophora bantiana pen 
icillium chrysogenum a penicillium sp sistotrema brinkmannii 
and the yeasts meyerozyma guilliermondii and rhodotorula muci 
laginosa interestingly a phialophora sp purpureocillium lilaci 
num trametes versicolor and some species of the agaricomycetes
were isolated only from the sample from mbsf and seemed to be
depth dependent beyond mbsf the diversity within our cul 
ture collection decreased considerably with only different spe 
cies being recovered including isolates belonging to the fusarium
genus one isolate identified as oidiodendron griseum that was iso 
lated only from mbsf and the red yeast rhodotorula mucilagi 
nosa one isolate sistotrema brinkmannii was obtained from
 mbsf and it was also retrieved from samples recovered at 
and mbsf 

diversity of fungal communities the ascomycota domi 
nated our filamentous fungal culture collection whereas the ba 
sidiomycota dominated our yeast collection this result appears
to be consistent with the findings of another phylogenetic analysis
of culturable fungi from deep sea sediments of the central indian
basin in our study among the yeasts rhodotorula mucilagi 
nosa was the most abundant species isolated from samples from
depths ranging from to mbsf the red yeast rhodotorula
mucilaginosa is widely distributed and has already been isolated
from deep sea sediments and basaltic crust – bullera unica 
isolated from mbsf in our study was the only isolate belonging
to the tremellomycetes interestingly bullera unica was previ 
ously isolated from new zealand seawater meyerozyma guil 
liermondii was the only ascomycetous yeast in our culture collec 
tion isolated from to mbsf culturable representatives of this
opportunistic pathogen have been detected in marine environ 
ments including hydrothermal vents and deep sea volcanoes
 and from canterbury basin sediments by culture indepen 
dent methods yeasts were previously suggested to be the
dominant marine fungal forms on the basis of fungus specific
clone libraries from marine water column and sediment environ 
ments here yeasts appeared to be able to adapt to and col 

onize the deep subseafloor but our results suggest that filamen 
tous fungi are more diverse in marine habitats than previously
suggested in agreement with the findings of molecular stud 
ies the classes eurotiomycetes and sordariomycetes are the fungal
taxa most frequently detected from deep sea environments 

among the sordariomycetes fusarium oxysporum is the most
abundant taxon f oxysporum has already been shown to grow
under marine conditions and was described to be a denitri 
fying fungus in marine sediments the other well repre 
sented members of the sordariomycetes were i fusarium solani 
recently detected from canterbury basin sediments using culture 
independent methods ii representatives of acremonium
spp already reported from several marine environments includ 
ing deep sea sediments iii sarocladium spp previ 
ously isolated from brine sediments iv representatives of
paecilomyces spp formerly isolated from deep sea coral and
from the first centimeter of coastal marine sediments off goa 
india and v microascus spp that may be opportunistic
pathogens of deep sea animals such as corals phialophora
spp purpureocillium lilacinum cordyceps confragosa and oidio 
dendron griseum were less represented in our culture collection 

among the eurotiomycetes penicillium was the most fre 
quently isolated genus molecular signatures of this genus were
previously found in the canterbury basin deep sediments 
fourteen fungal isolates of penicillium chrysogenum were ob 
tained this species was described to be the dominant phylotype
among the ascomycota in a dna based clone library prepared
from deep sea methane cold seep sediments the other well 
represented eurotiomycetes were i aspergillus fumigatus and
aspergillus terreus known to be able to germinate under hydro 
static pressure and ii eurotium herbariorum previously iso 
lated from other extreme environments including hypersaline
waters of solar salterns the hypersaline dead sea hydro 
thermal sediments and deep sea sediments 

the class dothideomycetes was represented in our culture
collection by isolates belonging to the genus cladosporium 
among the basidiomycota agaricomycetes were the most fre 
quently recovered with isolates being affiliated with bjerkandera
spp sistotrema brinkmannii trametes versicolor and uncultured
agaricomycetes although the cultivable representatives of agari 
comycetes appear to be rare in marine environments the
molecular signatures of agaricomycetes have been detected in
deep sea environments and agaricomycetes have
been identified to be the dominant fungal class in mangrove hab 
itats 

all of the fungal taxa isolated from canterbury basin are well 
known in terrestrial environments raising intriguing ecological
questions regarding the abilities of terrestrial fungi to adapt to
deep subsurface conditions that include confinement pressure 
temperature access to only refractory organic matter etc the
fungal taxa detected here using culture dependent methods can
be compared with fungal pyrotags previously obtained from
the same sediment core the two methods provided dif 
ferent pictures of diversity only fungal signatures and isolates
belonging to the genera exophiala fusarium penicillium rho 
dotorula and meyerozyma were detected by both culture inde 
pendent and culture dependent methods culture based and mo 
lecular diversity survey approaches appear here to provide two
complementary sources of information the fact that some iso 
lates have not been detected by molecular methods could be ex

plained by several reasons including the fact that fungal spores are
lysis resistant bias in universal primers and the use of a limited
 or insufficient sequencing depth efficient nucleic acid extrac 
tion from vegetative spores may be an important factor to con 
sider indeed previous results obtained by molecular analysis
based on rna suggest that few persistent subsurface fungal taxa
are able to colonize the deep subsurface of the canterbury basin
 our results strongly support the importance of applying a
polyphasic approach using culture dependent and culture inde 
pendent methods which together generate a general and compre 
hensive view of deep subsurface fungal diversity one of the main
advantages of handling fungal cultures is that the specific adapta 
tions that they use to cope with different stresses can be assessed 
ecophysiological analyses provide concrete and relevant data that
may be used to estimate their adaptations and understand the role
of fungal communities in the deep subsurface 

adaptation in our study we decided to examine the effect of
elevated hydrostatic pressure since this is likely to be one of the
most significant physical challenges for microbiota living in the
abyss we specifically examined whether cultivation under
increased pressure enhanced culture efficiency we also per 
formed ecophysiological analyses to examine the impacts of tem 
perature and salinity 

hydrostatic pressure enhanced the growth of a number of fun 
gal isolates in our culture collection about of our isolates
were obtained with a preliminary enrichment under elevated hy 
drostatic pressure thus the elevated hydrostatic and lithostatic
pressures in deep sediments do not curb the germination and
growth of all fungi in the deep subseafloor previous studies have
demonstrated efficient culturing of filamentous fungi and yeasts
under elevated hydrostatic pressure although
no true piezophilic fungi have been reported to date some fungi
are able to develop mechanisms of adaptation for example even
the well known yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to modify its
membrane composition to tolerate high hydrostatic pressure 
revealing the potential of fungi including terrestrial ones to adapt
to deep sea conditions 

temperature and salinity are two additional significant param 
eters used to examine the adaptation of fungi to deep subsurface
conditions indeed the temperature increases along the sediment
core at a rate of to °c per kilometer the temperature at the
bottom of the core hole at mbsf was estimated to be in the
range of from to °c salinities in sediment samples near
the seafloor are slightly lower than the salinity of normal seawater
at and salinity rapidly declines to at mbsf and re 
mains relatively constant at to over the rest of the core
section analyzed to mbsf our ecophysiological analysis
revealed shifts along the core most of the filamentous fungal iso 
lates analyzed shifted from nonhalophilic to halotolerant when
incubation temperatures increased from to °c only the
deepest fusarium and penicillium isolates demonstrated a com 
plete shift to halophily when the temperature increased such a
shift from terrestrially adapted to marine adapted lifestyles along
the core may indicate a transition from shallow layers where fungi
are not specifically adapted but are able to survive to deeper lay 
ers where fungi are more adapted to higher temperatures and
higher salinities ecophysiological studies on deep subseafloor
prokaryotes are scarce biddle et al used a low salt medium
 r a to culture bacterial strains from deep sediments of the peru
margin and obtained colonies only from shallow depth layers 

this may indicate the occurrence of nonmarine strains in the first
layers and endemic or adapted strains at deeper layers even if the
possibility of a decrease in isolation success with depth cannot be
ruled out however another study described some generalist sub 
seafloor sediment bacteria to be more adapted to different envi 
ronmental conditions than their surface counterparts such
results strongly support our conclusions 

fungi detected by culture based and molecular approaches in
the deep subseafloor biosphere may range from those that are
buried alive and are simply dormant to those that adapt to sub 
surface conditions the same trend is observed for bacterial en 
dospores that are as abundant as vegetative prokaryotic cells in the
deep biosphere recently jørgensen proposed that most
deep subseafloor microbial cells are on physiological standby and
that only a few cells may be active at any given time the metabolic
activities of long buried microbes could be activated due to tec 
tonic activity or if subsurface fluid flows deliver an infusion of new
electron donors and acceptors this hypothesis fits well with our
finding that some fungi may possess a range of physiological ad 
aptations for handling different physical and chemical stressors 
while others might be microbial zombies complementary
genomic transcriptomic and proteomic analyses are needed to
better understand the metabolic capabilities of deep subseafloor
fungi 

biotechnological potential of deep sediment fungal isolates 
many marine microorganisms have been screened for novel bio 
active compounds and some research has been specifi 
cally dedicated to marine fungal secondary metabolites in
this study we examined the secondary metabolite synthesis po 
tential of deep subsurface fungal isolates under the assumption
that deep sea sediments represent an untapped reservoir of bio 
and chemodiversity 

almost all fungal isolates had at least one gene involved
in a secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway this clearly indi 
cates their genetic potential for the synthesis of numerous second 
ary metabolites many of these genes might be responsible for the
biosynthesis of natural compounds that may help these fungi to
compete with other microorganisms for available substrates 
isolates affiliated with the genera penicillium fusarium paecilo 
myces and rhodotorula have genetic differences depending on
sampling depth taxa from shallow depths from to mbsf 
harbored type iii pks genes while taxa from deeper layers from
 to mbsf did not these subseafloor fungi may have lost or
gained some of these genes in order to adapt to their environment 
indeed as previously demonstrated secondary metabolism gene
clusters evolve rapidly through multiple rearrangements duplica 
tions or losses it may confirm our conclusion that some of
these isolates exhibit evidence of ecophysiological adaptation 
more detailed genome based and or phylogenetic analyses should
be performed to determine their evolutionary origin 

our results i demonstrate our success in isolating some rep 
resentatives of fungal taxa occurring within deep subseafloor
communities ii give insights into their adaptation to subsurface
in situ conditions with fungi from deeper layers appearing to be
more adapted to deep subseafloor conditions and iii illustrate
the potential for their synthesis of genes for secondary metabolites
of possible biotechnological importance while new molecular
methods have recently allowed the genetic capacities of uncul 
tured microorganisms to be studied using single cell genomics
and metatranscriptomics many important physiological features
