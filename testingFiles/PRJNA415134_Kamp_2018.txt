abstract

intracellular nitrate is an important electron acceptor in oxygen deficient aquatic environments either for the
nitrate storing microbes themselves or for ambient microbial communities through nitrate leakage this study links the
spatial distribution of intracellular nitrate with the abundance and identity of nitrate storing microbes in sediments of the
bornholm basin an environmental showcase for severe hypoxia intracellular nitrate up to nmol cm− sediment was
detected at all stations along a km transect through the basin and typically extended as deep as cm into the
sediment intracellular nitrate contents were particularly high at stations where chlorophyll contents suggested high
settling rates of pelagic primary production the depth distribution of intracellular nitrate matched that of the
diatom specific photopigment fucoxanthin in the upper cm and calculations support that diatoms are the major
nitrate storing microbes in these sediments in contrast other known nitrate storing microbes such as sulfide oxidizing
bacteria and foraminifers played only a minor role if any strikingly s rrna gene sequencing revealed that the majority
of the diatoms in the sediment were pelagic species we conclude that intracellular nitrate stored by pelagic diatoms is
transported to the seafloor by settling phytoplankton blooms implying a so far overlooked ’biological nitrate pump’

introduction

oxygen is the energetically most favorable electron accep 
tor that enables respiration coupled to energy conservation
across the tree of life in oxygen deficient environments many

prokaryotes and a few microbial eukaryotes can alternatively
use no − for anaerobic respiration through denitrification and
other pathways of dissimilatory no − reduction unlike the gas
o no − can be accumulated and stored inside living cells 
which enables the uncoupling of no − uptake and use in space

form of inorganic nitrogen i e no − to the seafloor where it can
be readily used in dissimilatory metabolic pathways it can be

centration of ∼ mmol l− since diatoms are known to store
nitrate in concentrations of up to mmol l− the diatoms
present in the sediment readily explain the measured sedimen 
tary intracellular no − it needs to be noted though that the
cellular fucoxanthin content may vary with environmental fac 
tors and the physiological state of the diatoms for instance 
the cellular fucoxanthin content decreases by ∼ within days
to weeks after shifts from light oxic to dark anoxic conditions
that diatoms may experience when they settle onto hypoxic
or anoxic sediments kamp et al thus the same mea 
sured sedimentary fucoxanthin concentration would then cor 
respond to a ∼ fold higher diatom abundance which requires
an even lower diatom specific intracellular no − concentration
to explain the sedimentary intracellular no − concentration 
fucoxanthin was also found well below the intracellular no −

layer where it is likely associated with diatom cells that have
entered a resting stage härnström et al piredda et al 
obviously these resting diatom cells do not store intracellular
no − because of the high energy demand for establishing and
maintaining a steep concentration gradient across the cell wall
 harold in contrast fucoxanthin degradation proceeds
relatively slowly even in pelagic diatoms that are exposed to
dark anoxic conditions kamp et al and therefore fucox 
anthin persists also in deeper sediment layers

to skeletonema marinoi chaetoceros spp and thalassiosira hispida 
which all are ubiquitous bloom forming diatoms the spring
bloom in the bornholm basin is also dominated by these three
genera wasmund nausch and matthaus fluorescence
measurements of sinking diatom blooms down to m water
depth in the bornholm basin showed that the spring bloom set 
tles from april to may van beusekom et al thus in our
survey in the beginning of june the diatom community in the
top sediment layers was obviously marked by the freshly set 
tled spring bloom together with the above reasoning on the
vertical distribution of fucoxanthin it appears that much of the
intracellular no − in the sediment of the bornholm basin is
imported and stored by settled pelagic diatoms in contrast pen 
nate diatoms with a benthic life style were only marginally rep 
resented in the s rrna gene sequence libraries 

the settling of diatom blooms is mediated through aggre 
gated cells that rapidly sink through the water column all

cher such diatom aggregates will reach the sediment of

 nmol no − per aggregate stief et al a similar no −

transport mechanism has earlier been suggested for a shallow
coastal bay lomstein jensen and sørensen and is sup 
ported here by the very high intracellular no − concentrations
in the methane saturated sediments that experience the high 
est sedimentation rates within the bornholm basin jensen and

spring bloom in the bornholm basin contains – μmol

cellular no − found in this study i e – μmol intra

diatoms and diatom aggregates exposed to completely anoxic
conditions kamp et al kamp et al raises the ques 
tion about the fate of the imported intracellular no − in oxygen 
deficient sediments two different metabolic pathways for sur 
viving dark anoxic conditions have only recently been discov 
ered in diatoms dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium
 dnra kamp et al and dark fermentation bourke et al 
 the intracellular no − of decaying diatom cells however 
will leak into the immediate microenvironment where it can be
used by other microbes as previously observed in sinking diatom
aggregates kamp et al this process continues once the
diatom aggregates have settled onto the sediment marzocchi
et al 

filamentous sob and other nitrate storing microbes

diatoms and sob co occurred at the same stations also where
the total intracellular no − contents were high however the
vertical distribution of beggiatoa and thioploca was very patchy
and consequently sob biovolume and intracellular no − were
not significantly correlated furthermore our data imply that
sob cannot account for much of the sedimentary intracellular
no − sob in the depth interval – cm would need to store

as the eukaryotic foraminifers and gromiids risgaard petersen
et al høgslund et al which were neither detected
by microscopy nor by s rrna gene sequencing eukaryotic
microbes known or suspected to store no − at very low concen 
trations such as dino flagellates chlorophytes and ascomycete
fungi dortch et al lomas and glibert stief et al 
kamp et al were occasionally retrieved by s rrna gene
sequencing but had low relative sequence abundances at sta 
tions with high intracellular no − concentrations therefore 
the role of settled pelagic diatoms as the main nitrate storing
microbes in sediments of the bornholm basin is not seriously
challenged by any other group of microbes 

environmental controls

the proposed mechanism of no − transport to the seafloor by
settling diatom blooms implies that pelagic primary produc 
tion and sedimentation rates are important environmental con 
trol factors the baltic sea is well known for its high and still
increasing level of eutrophication that entails extensive phyto 
plankton blooms and o deficiency in deep basins wasmund 
nausch and matthaus tamelander and heiskanen 
carstensen et al hansson and andersson how 
ever the pulse like settling events in the wake of phytoplankton
blooms vary both locally and in their timing wasmund nausch
and matthaus in the bornholm basin the settling of the
spring bloom is expected in april and may van beusekom et al 
 at station and the interplay of particle sedimenta 
tion and water currents leads to a particularly strong accumu 
lation of mud that is followed by intense organic matter degra 
dation and methanogenesis jensen and endler pimenov
et al consequently the sedimentary chlorophyll a con 
tents as a proxy for the settling rate of phytoplankton blooms 

were significantly correlated with the intracellular no − con 
tents along the transect it can be expected that the intracellular
no − stored by settled diatoms shows a pulse like seasonal pat 
tern at least directly at the sediment surface lomstein jensen
and sørensen 

filamentous sob and other non phototrophic microbes
capable of no − storage are more likely influenced by organic
matter degradation in the sediment the thickness of the
holocene mud layer increases along the transect towards greater
water depths jensen and endler accordingly the extent
of organic matter degradation increases which results in higher
nh fluxes and sulfate reduction rates additionally the ch 
entrapped in the thickest mud layer allows sulfide production
through anaerobic ch oxidation pimenov et al leading
to a sulfide flux into the bottom water karlson rosenberg and
bonsdorff in this setting sob may readily use their intra 
cellular no − for sulfide oxidation through dnra otte et al 
 while the motile filamentous sob can meet their no −

demands by stretching out into the bottom water dunker et al 
 non motile microbes might be limited by no − availabil 
ity in the sediment the very low o concentration at the sed 
iment surface is likely inhibiting nitrification activity despite
a high nh flux towards the sediment surface consequently 
nitrification cannot drive the intracellular nitrate accumulation
of other microbes in contrast to what was previously shown for
diatoms in oxygen rich intertidal sediments heisterkamp et al 
 it is therefore not surprising that nh fluxes as a proxy
for organic matter degradation in the sediment and intracel 
lular no − contents were not significantly correlated along the
transect in contrast to the pulse like nitrate import through set 
tling diatom blooms many biogeochemical processes in the sed 
iment and bottom water show only a weak seasonality and thus
the sob specific intracellular no − pool is small but probably
more stable over time 

conclusions

this study demonstrates that pelagic diatoms rather than ben 
thic microbes represent the major cellular reservoir of no −

in the sediment of a strongly hypoxic marine basin settling
diatom blooms presumably transport the intracellular no −

pool to the seafloor where it may serve as an energetically

favorable electron acceptor in dissimilatory processes in con 
trast microbes commonly considered to harbor the bulk of
intracellular no − in low oxygen environments such as fila 
mentous sob and foraminifers were unimportant no − reser 
voirs at the time of this study we anticipate that the proposed
no − transport mechanism through settling diatom blooms
can be found in a wide range of shallow aquatic ecosystems
with high pelagic primary production for instance in coastal
marine areas and freshwater lakes experiencing eutrophication 
diatom associated intracellular no − pools in sediments may
thus be more ubiquitous than sob associated pools but more
likely show seasonal variation it is worth noting that the settling
of diatom blooms will promote no − removal from the euphotic
zone and thus corresponds to a ’biological nitrate pump’ the
efficiency of this pump is re inforced by settled diatom aggre 
gates that stimulate benthic denitrification in oxygen deficient
sediments partially also at the expense of the intracellular
no − stored by the diatoms pelagic benthic coupling of nitro 
gen cycling as mediated by the ’biological nitrate pump’ is fur 
ther expected to be more immediate than through mineraliza 
tion and nitrification of settled particulate organic nitrogen
