microplastics mp constitute a widespread contaminant all over the globe rivers
and wastewater treatment plants wwtp transport annually several million tons of
mp into freshwaters estuaries and oceans where they provide increasing artificial
surfaces for microbial colonization as knowledge on mp attached communities is
insufficient for brackish ecosystems we conducted exposure experiments in the coastal
baltic sea an in flowing river and a wwtp within the drainage basin while reporting
on prokaryotic and fungal communities from the same set up previously we focus
here on the entire eukaryotic communities using high throughput s rrna gene
sequencing we analyzed the eukaryotes colonizing on two types of mp polyethylene
and polystyrene and compared them to the ones in the surrounding water and on
a natural surface wood more than different taxa across almost all kingdoms of
the eukaryotic tree of life were identified on mp dominated by alveolata metazoa and
chloroplastida the eukaryotic community composition on mp was significantly distinct
from wood and the surrounding water with overall lower diversity and the potentially
harmful dinoflagellate pfiesteria being enriched on mp co occurrence networks which
include prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa hint at possibilities for dynamic microbial
interactions on mp this first report on total eukaryotic communities on mp in brackish
environments highlights the complexity of mp associated biofilms potentially leading to
altered microbial activities and hence changes in ecosystem functions

introduction

along with the exponential increase of plastic products in the past decades the environmental
pollution with plastic is constantly growing galloway et al geyer et al nowadays 
“microplastics” mp plastic particles with a size below mm can be found in most aquatic
environments eerkes medrano et al law where they interact with organisms
ranging from bacteria and algae to mammals zettler et al gall and thompson clark
et al an important aspect of this pollution is that plastic provides an enormous surface
for microbial colonization and drifting mp can function as a vector for micro organism dispersal
 keswani et al for a long time it is known that various eukaryotes such as diatoms and
hydroids settle on mp carpenter and smith however it took more than years until

the colonization of plastic received more scientific attention 
questions were raised whether mp could facilitate the spread of
harmful algae masó et al potential pathogens kirstein
et al viršek et al or invasive species barnes 
the majority of studies in the field are focused on bacterial mp
colonization hoellein et al mccormick et al 
 whereas eukaryotic communities were often considered
secondarily or analyzed solely microscopically allowing for a
relatively low coverage and taxonomic resolution masó et al 
 carson et al zettler et al oberbeckmann
et al reisser et al bryant et al though mp
biofilms comprise a high number of different micro eukaryotes 
solely a few systematic and detailed studies exist oberbeckmann
et al debroas et al kettner et al this
scientific field is still at an early stage in describing the occurrence
of micro eukaryotes on this anthropogenically introduced 
artificial habitat and we are far away from understanding the
ecological consequences neither on local communities nor on
the global ecosystem scale hence a more holistic knowledge is
required to better understand ecosystem and health related issues
emerging from plastic pollution 

it has been shown that location based on differences in
environmental conditions is one significant factor influencing
the microbial community composition on mp hoellein et al 
 oberbeckmann et al emphasizing the need that
studies should cover a wide range of ecosystems around the globe 

our study area the baltic sea is one of the world’s largest
brackish ecosystems its catchment area includes countries
with approximately rivers and million people it is known 
that rivers play a crucial role in transporting mp to seas and
oceans lechner et al talvitie et al mccormick
et al lebreton et al mintenig et al as
the surface area of the baltic sea is four times smaller than
its drainage area and since the average water residence time
is three to four decades its ecosystem suffers eminently from
severe anthropogenic pressures such as eutrophication chemical
contamination overfishing and intense shipping traffic snoeijs 
leijonmalm and andrén today the baltic sea ranks
among the most polluted seas worldwide helcom 
and mp have emerged as additional anthropogenic pressure 
quantitative information on mp pollution in the baltic sea and
its drainage basin however is scarce talvitie et al setälä
et al lebreton et al mp including synthetic fibers
seem to be nearly omnipresent in samples from baltic beaches
in germany stolte et al poland graca et al 
and the kaliningrad region esiukova in the surface
water of the river warnow and baltic coast around rostock 
germany polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps are among the
most commonly found types of mp unpublished data leibniz
institute for baltic sea research warnemünde 

we did set up a day incubation experiment investigating
the microbial colonization of two types of mp namely pe and
ps in comparison with the natural surface wood in the baltic
sea the river warnow and a wwtp detailed analyses of the
prokaryotic and fungal communities within these biofilms have
already been published kettner et al oberbeckmann et al 
 here we now focus on the entire eukaryotic diversity 

beyond our project prokaryotic and eukaryotic mp colonization
in brackish ecosystems has not been investigated thoroughly 

we used results from illumina miseq sequencing to test
our hypothesis that eukaryotic mp attached communities are
distinct from communities on a natural surface wood and the
surrounding water wood was chosen as a reference material
since it occurs widely in natural aquatic systems is degraded
slowly and has a specific gravity similar to our plastics used 
further we analyzed if the beta diversity is different on these
tested substrate types and we evaluate whether eukaryotic
assemblages differ among seven incubation sites located in
a salinity gradient from the river warnow into the baltic
sea we performed network analyses comprising prokaryotic
and eukaryotic taxa to reveal which organisms co occur and
might interact with each other our detailed and holistic view
into community compositions will provide new insights into
the microbial life on mp in aquatic ecosystems and related
consequences for ecosystem functioning

where conventional wwtps would discharge into the receiving
waters this wwtp has an additional treatment stage with an
oxygenated biofilm reactor station is located at the outlet
of that reactor further details on the incubation experiments
and sampling locations including environmental parameters and
coordinates are given by kettner et al 

dna extraction pcr amplification 
sequencing and sequence processing
dna extraction from pe ps wood and filtered water samples
was carried out based on a protocol published by nercessian
et al which was optimized for our samples the
procedure includes a chemical mechanical and enzymatic cell
lysis step followed by phenol chloroform extraction and an
ethanol precipitation of extracted nucleic acids dna was
amplified by pcr using the universal eukaryote primers eu f
and eu r stoeck et al with addition of the bases
 tga at the ′ end of the reverse primer according to
lgc genomics berlin germany which target the highly
variable v region of the s rrna gene allowing for one
mismatch these primers cover of al eukaryota in the
silva database v while excluding bacteria and archaea
 supplementary table s pcr amplifications and subsequent
sequencing on the illumina miseq platform ∗ bp paired
end miseq reagent kit v were performed by lgc genomics 
berlin germany raw illumina reads were demultiplexed then
barcodes adapters and primers were clipped reads were further
processed in mothur v schloss et al released in
march following the mothur miseq sop adapted to our
target region kozich et al url https www mothur

were classified in mothur using silva’s non redundant small
subunit rrna database v quast et al released in
september taxonomy was based on the current silva
taxonomy yilmaz et al database v with the deepest
possible taxonomic resolution at the genus level eukaryotic
taxa are herein named according to their genus for instance
ostreococcus or – if no genus could be assigned – after the next
higher classified level with the prefix “unclassified” for instance
unclassified rhinosporidiosis further details on methods
from dna extraction to sequence processing were described
previously by kettner et al raw reads were made
available under biosample accessions from samn to
samn of the bioproject prjna at the short
read archive sra of ncbi 

data evaluation and statistics
the final output is a read abundance table with all taxonomic
levels the lists of the top taxa per substrate were created
based on relative abundances after a transformation of the data
 legendre and gallagher bar charts were compiled on
kingdom level for the different substrates types pe ps wood 
water µm and µm water µm and locations
 station and second we statistically evaluated
the read abundance table for the deepest taxonomic levels using
r version r core team and the r package

vegan oksanen et al to test whether the factors
“substrate type” and “location” had a significant effect p 
on the eukaryotic community composition we performed a
permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova 
and pairwise permanova adonis function in vegan 
permutations prior to that the table was hellinger transformed
 legendre and gallagher and converted into a bray curtis
similarity matrix a prerequisite for correct interpretation of
permanova results is to check for homogeneity of dispersion 
which we did with the betadisper and permutest function in
vegan permutations a two dimensional nmds plot was
created to visualize the bray curtis similarity among the 
samples in addition we calculated the bray curtis similarity
between each pair of substrates and stations respectively the
eukaryotic diversity on different substrate types was calculated
with the “chaojost” estimator for continuous diversity profiles
 chao and jost applying the diversity function of the r
package spader version chao et al before that 
read abundances were added up for each substrate type and
rarefied to reads to assure for comparability of diversity
among substrates continuous diversity profiles function qḋ 
see chao and jost and specific hill numbers richness
for q shannon diversity for q and simpson diversity
for q were plotted with confidence intervals using the
r package ggplot version wickham to check if
specific taxa were significantly associated with a single substrate
type we performed an “indicator species analysis” r package
indicspecies de cáceres and legendre de cáceres
and jansen obtained p values from multiple testing
in pairwise permanova and indicator species analysis were
adjusted according to benjamini and hochberg 

phylogenetic trees
phylogenetic trees were compiled of the most abundant taxa
per substrate type representative sequences most abundant
sequence within the according taxon were aligned using the
sina aligner v pruesse et al and phylogenetically
analyzed using the arb software package arb ludwig
et al with the silva non redundant small subunit
rrna database v quast et al reduced to eukaryotic
sequences after adding the aligned sequences to the arb
database the alignment was checked manually and the –
 bp long sequences along with their close relatives were
used to calculate the trees the phylogenetic relationships were
deduced by the neighbor joining method and bootstrap values
were obtained by calculating bootstrap trees 

network analysis
for the network analyses of pe ps and wood associated
biofilms we combined both prokaryote oberbeckmann et al 
 and eukaryote datasets which were independently
hellinger transformed legendre and gallagher 
beforehand water samples were not included as the objective
was herein to characterize interaction possibilities within biofilm
communities only with regard to the strong differences in
community composition we calculated the networks separately

eukaryotic communities across
different substrate types and locations
from all samples with more than million reads we
were able to identify different eukaryotic taxa on pe and
ps we detected and different taxa respectively the
 taxa were assigned to different kingdoms common
representatives of our samples were from the sar supergroup
 stramenopiles alveolata rhizaria fungi holozoa
including metazoa and different algae especially chloroplastida 
the composition of kingdoms varied across the substrate types
and locations figure for instance water samples had a higher
proportion of cryptophyceae whereas pe and ps had more reads
assigned to a kingdom within holozoa mainly from the order
rhinosporideacae compared to samples from the river warnow
and the baltic sea stations to wwtp samples stations
 and had almost no cryptophyceae and haptophyta fewer
chloroplastida but more holozoa 

we compiled a list of the most abundant taxa by read
counts for a rough description of eukaryotic communities of the
different substrate types supplementary table s these top
 taxa comprise ca to of the respective community 
additionally we calculated phylogenetic trees for all substrate
types that show the closest relatives of these top taxa 
i e their representative sequence respectively supplementary
figure s when comparing the top taxa across the different
substrate types supplementary figure s and table s we
observe omnipresent taxa as well as taxa differentially abundant
on one substrate or another among the top taxa on pe and
ps we found organisms from different trophic levels green algae
from the genus ulva sea lettuce and the class trebouxiophyceae
were common primary producers in mp biofilms as primary
or secondary consumers we detected different ciliates assigned
to peritrichia the conthreep group specifically zoothamnium
and the suctorian ephelota consumers from the kingdom
metazoa animalia were the rotifers adinetida and ploimida 
the nematodes diplogasterida and rhabditida the mollusk
caenogastropoda and the crustacean podocopida with the
ability to retain kleptochloroplasts from their prey burkholder
and marshall we found the dinoflagellate pfiesteria as
a potential temporary mixotroph we further identified fungi

from chytridiomycota for instance chytridium as well as fungal 
like organisms such as rhinosporideacae rhizidiomyces and
pythium which can have saprotrophic or parasitic life styles 
common organisms from the smaller water fraction to
 µm were picoeukaryotic green algae such as ostreococcus
and micromonas the cryptophytes leucocitos and teleaulax or
the heterotrophic picomonas which were all rare on the solid
substrates in comparison to pe and ps the larger water fraction
 µm contained more phototrophs such as the diatoms
skeletonema and thalassiosira or the green algae scenedesmus 
the compilation of the top taxa on wood were similar to
those on pe and ps but included the fungus lkm among the
dominant organisms

co occurrence networks
to evaluate interaction possibilities among taxa within

contain not only eukaryotic but also prokaryotic taxa figure 
and supplementary figure s with nodes labeled with taxon
names each node of a network represents a different taxon
and the edges are significant positive correlations between the

positive correlations among prokaryotes eukaryotes as well
as between prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa particularly in
the wwtp figure table and supplementary figure
s beside the variety of bacterial taxa eukaryotic taxa of
the kingdoms chloroplastida alveolata and stramenopiles
dominated within the co occurrence networks especially on

discussion

effect of substrate type and location on
eukaryotic communities
our results support the hypothesis that substrate type has
a significant impact on eukaryotic community composition
in aquatic systems eukaryotic communities on mp differed
from those on floating wood and in the surrounding water 
the lowest similarities were found between communities of
the smaller water size fraction to µm and solid
substrates pe ps and wood and might be a result of the
lifestyle of certain picoeukaryotes dominating in these water
samples small organisms such as ostreococcus and micromonas

have a high surface to volume ratio which is advantageous
for the uptake of nutrients i e they are well adapted for
living freely in the water column and this could explain their
lower abundances on the solid substrates distinct differences
between communities on mp on natural surfaces and in
water have been shown previously also for bacterial and fungal
communities from the same experimental set up kettner et al 
 oberbeckmann et al as well as in other marine
and freshwater studies hoellein et al mccormick et al 
 oberbeckmann et al this suggests that
plastic affects both prokaryotic and eukaryotic community
compositions alike no significant differences were detected
between the eukaryotic communities on pe and ps which is in
accordance with other studies comparing microbial communities
between plastic and other hard substrates hoellein et al 
oberbeckmann et al despite low sample replication 
other studies however hint at distinct microbial colonization
patterns among different plastic polymer types zettler et al 
 debroas et al plastic associated communities also
differ from organic substrates hoellein et al mccormick
et al which is confirmed by our comparison of
communities on mp vs wood 

besides the outlined effect of substrate type we identified
a strong impact of location on eukaryotic community
composition location dependency of plastic associated
microbial communities has been observed previously hoellein
et al oberbeckmann et al amaral 
zettler et al kettner et al and as it is generally
accepted that local environmental factors are influencing
microbial colonization patterns we will not further discuss
this in more detail 

in general the existing studies on microbial plastic
colonization are difficult to compare especially due to differences
in sampling environments seasons plastic types biofilm age
or approaches to identify species nevertheless we can see
several similarities i e the occurrence of diatoms as early
colonizers a high frequency of organisms from the sar group
including dinoflagellates and the suctorian ephelota as well as

different algae and holozoans carpenter and smith masó
et al carson et al zettler et al hoellein
et al bryant et al oberbeckmann et al 
debroas et al despite the small particle sizes of mp 
we identified numerous organisms assigned to the kingdom
metazoa animalia such as nematodes rotifers or annelids
suggesting they attach to mp mainly as eggs larvae and juveniles 
or their environmental dna edna adsorbed to the particle 
we assume that the retrieved high read abundances of metazoans
might rather reflect their multicellularity than the actual number
of individuals in contrast to previous studies our incubation
experiment revealed a remarkably diversity fungal taxa kettner
et al and enabled us to report here for the first time a
pfiesteria related dinoflagellate as the dominant taxon on mp 
the high sequencing depth and sample number allowed us to
capture a higher eukaryotic diversity and at the same time we
obtained a deeper taxonomic resolution than previous studies 

diversity and co occurrence patterns of
microorganisms on mp
taking together all mp samples we identified more than 
different eukaryotic taxa and the majority of eukaryotic kingdoms
from the tree of life were present yet the eukaryotic diversity was
significantly lower on mp than on wood or in the surrounding
water µm also in other studies mp communities were
found to be less diverse than in water zettler et al 
debroas et al as we detected respectively solely one
taxon that was specifically associated with pe or ps and due to
the lower diversity we assume that mp was colonized mainly by
opportunistic eukaryotes possibly pe and ps rather excluded
organisms than attracting a specialized mp community maybe
a longer incubation time would lead to more mature biofilms
with possibly more micro niches for a number of additional
organisms though wood was exposed over the same time span it
showed the highest eukaryotic diversity the higher attractiveness
of wood for microeukaryotic colonization compared to mp may
have been caused by its rougher surface facilitating microbial cell

attachment additionally bacteria and fungi can utilize wood
as a substrate source which renders nutrients available also to
other organisms and thus increases organismic diversity other
researchers provide hints that also plastic might be degraded to
a certain degree by the attached bacterial and fungal community
 zettler et al mccormick et al debroas et al 
although we did not check for mp bio degradation we assume it
is an inferior process since easier accessible nutrient and carbon
sources are available in the mp biofilms mainly provided by
photoautotrophic algae 

biofilms on mp and wood harbored various organisms
simultaneously which suggests a number of possible interactions
such as symbiosis predator prey relationships infections or the
collective degradation of organic matter indeed our network
analyses revealed many positive correlations among eukaryotes
and especially among bacteria as well as between bacteria
and different eukaryotic kingdoms for instance the numerous
positive correlations between fungal and bacterial taxa on
wood could support the idea of a collective metabolization
of this substrate amoebophyra a dinoflagellate known to
infect other dinoflagellates kim et al was positively
correlated to the occurrence of suessiaceae on pe and another
unclassified dinoflagellate on ps which could indicate a
parasitic relationship the positive correlations on pe and ps
of the suctorian ephelota and different bacterial taxa might
be explained by ectosymbiosis which has been previously
observed microscopically on mp by zettler et al 
interestingly even with a sulfite oxidizing bacterium on ps 
the picoeukaroyte micromonas was positively correlated to the
bacterium eudoraea family flavobacteriaceae and on pe to
another bacterium of the order flavobacteriales as well as
to litoreibacter familiy rhodobacteraceae in experimental
studies several flavobacteria and alphaproteobacteria including
rhodobacteraceae were able to assimilate micromonas derived
proteins orsi et al which could hint at interactions
between these organisms for the cycling of nitrogen also in our
experiment beside bacteria micromonas was further correlated
to protists while this picoeukaryote is mainly grazed by
dinoflagellates in open seawater orsi et al it might
have been consumed by ciliates in biofilms since micromonas
co occurred with vorticella zoothamnium and holosticha on
pe a significant co occurrence can unfortunately only indicate
but not prove for a microbial interaction faust and raes 
 certainly many organisms simply co exist together as
they prefer similar environmental niches e g the photosynthetic
bacterium erythrobacter which occurred on pe and ps together
with the algae picochlorum although pe and ps associated
community compositions had a high bray curtis similarity it
seems challenging to identify many similarities in their co 
occurrence patterns this might give a first hint that other
interaction possibilities exist on pe and ps even though their
biofilm communities are overlapping moreover on pe and ps
bacterial communities were more tightly linked to eukaryotic
communities than on the natural substrate wood this interesting
finding hints to the fact that both plastic types do not serve as a
bacterial substrate source rather than surfaces for colonization 
the tight linkage of prokaryotic with eukaryotic communities
implies that bacterial communities on mp are to a large

extent controlled by the dynamics of micro eukaryotes both
as a substrate source and interaction partner another relevant
observation from the pe ps and wood co occurrence networks
was the obvious cluster formation by sampling locations this
highlights that not merely the substrate type but rather the
locations – i e the local environmental factors – influenced the
community compositions as well as their associated patterns of
taxon co occurrence meaning their interaction possibilities 

relevance of mp colonization for
aquatic ecosystems
a plastic item with a mass of one gram floating in the open
sea can harbor significantly more organismic biomass compared
to one thousand liter of surrounding seawater mincer et al 
 hence the colonization of floating mp can have various
implications for aquatic ecosystems 

first we observed a strong enrichment of pfiesteria reads
on mp in comparison to the surrounding water the respective
sequence was closely related to the species pfiesteria piscicida 
which is able to produce toxins moeller et al and is
associated with harmful blooms and major fish kills glasgow
et al toxic pfiesteria strains can harm fishes by the
toxin release itself but also by physically attacking the epidermis
 burkholder and marshall further pfiesteria piscicida
is able to form resting stages coyne et al which is
particularly relevant for the survival and transport on mp to
habitats far away also the dinoflagellate heterocapsa was present
on mp certain species within the heterocapsa genus are able to
form toxic red tides which can cause mass mortality of bivalves
 horiguchi moreover we detected numerous potentially
parasitic eukaryotes such as zoosporic fungi kettner et al 
or the peronosporomycetes former oomycetes pythium and
lagenidium unfortunately the short fragment length required
for illumina amplicon sequencing does not provide a resolution
to species or strain level and is not giving any information on the
life stage making predictions of toxicity or infection potentials
difficult nevertheless we show that various potentially harmful
eukaryotes or their close relatives can colonize and even enrich on
mp consequently our results support findings from masó et al 
 who suggested plastic debris as a vector for harmful algal
bloom species in marine environments 

second we need to consider the persistence of mp due to
extremely low degradation rates shah et al andrady 
 compared to naturally occurring particles such as fecal
pellets algal aggregates or driftwood mp offers a durable
dispersal medium for the above mentioned harmful organisms
as well as potential human pathogens kirstein et al fish
pathogens viršek et al or bloom forming dinoflagellates
 masó et al potentially transporting them with ocean
currents over thousands of kilometers law et al this
poses a serious threat to aquaculture horiguchi moestrup
et al wildlife and humans barnes estimated
that human litter whereof the majority is plastic more than
doubles the rafting opportunities for all kinds of organisms 
which may threaten the global marine biodiversity for the baltic
sea maritime transport is currently the most important factor for
the introduction of non indigenous species oesterwind et al

kettner et al eukaryotic communities on microplastics

 our study highlights that also mp has to be considered
as an additional and even more frequent transport medium for
numerous species in the baltic sea 

third floating colonized mp has the potential to change
carbon nutrient and energy dynamics in the aquatic
realm recently yokota et al reported on increased
photosynthetic activities of cyanobacteria on mp since we
detected numerous different algae on mp we can also assume
an increase in eukaryotic photosynthetic activity following mp
colonization bryant et al concluded that mp creates
net autotrophic hot spots in the oligotrophic sea furthermore 
the colonization of mp kaiser et al as well as the
incorporation of mp into algal aggregates long et al or
zooplankton fecal pellets cole et al alters the overall load 
leading either to enhanced sinking or floating of particles since
organic aggregates represent the main vehicles for transport of
organic matter from the sea surface to the bottom ducklow
et al mp has the potential to affect the oceanic carbon
pump and vertical fluxes of nutrients 

conclusion

our study demonstrates that mp biofilms in brackish and
freshwater ecosystems comprise complex communities
representing several trophic levels and interaction possibilities
between them when judging the potential ecological impact
and the risk of dispersal of invasive or harmful organisms 
the complexity and dynamic nature of mp biofilms have to be
considered especially in terms of their location dependency 
our study provides evidence that biodiversity on mp is limited
compared to natural surfaces and that potential pathogens
and parasites can thrive and even enrich on plastic surfaces in
the future studies on survival rates during mp migration as
well as systematic risk assessments regarding the impact of mp
on biodiversity and infection potentials as well as ecosystem
functions are vitally needed 

originality significance
statement

the pollution of aquatic environments with microplastics is
of increasing relevance due to the high persistence toward
mineralization leading to global debris accumulation with
potential effects on organisms of all trophic levels microplastics
can serve as transport vehicles for attached microbes including
potentially invasive or harmful organisms with yet unknown
consequences for wildlife so far the colonization of microplastics
in brackish waters has been understudied and little attention
has been paid to microeukaryotic colonizers herein we
present a detailed report on eukaryotic community compositions
in the baltic sea a river and a wastewater treatment
plant based on next generation sequencing results we show
how microplastic associated eukaryotic communities differ
from natural communities in water or on wood regarding
their composition and diversity moreover this is the first
study providing co occurrence networks for polyethylene 

polystyrene and wood while including prokaryotes as well
as eukaryotes highlighting their vast interaction possibilities 
taking all results together we provide an in depth view
into microplastic associated assemblages while discussing their
potential environmental implications which will push forward
our understanding of the eukaryotic life in microplastic biofilms
