abstract 

intensified biomass harvesting could prove to be negative for forest ecological health 

through the impacts this type of forest management could exert on microbial community 

structure and function in forest soils and in cwd pools microbial community functional 

characteristics as well as community structure through t rflp and pyrotag sequencing of ssu 

rrna were assayed soils in a boreal jack pine forest exposed to a clearcut intensified harvesting 

gradient microbial communities within cwd of various decay stages were also assessed in 

order to determine habitat specificity of the decomposer communities within them soil 

microbial communities were altered by harvesting but intensification did not cause further 

disturbance soils in harvested sites were different from fire sites also assayed meaning that 

these disturbance types may have different impacts on microbial community structure and 

functioning cwd communities within logs had different characteristics in different sites 

intensification could reduce site specific organisms important in decay initiation

acknowledgments 

i would like to acknowledge some associates with whom i have shared in the trials and 

tribulations of this masters project without the excellent teachings of michael preston i don’t 

know if i would have been able to trust my own t rflp data i must admit that the ’s music 

thrumming through the lab was uplifting as well the guidance of caroline sadlier through the 

intimidating process of learning qiime turned the program equivalent of a ravenous lion into 

something closer to one of those inbred lions they use for photo opportunities in florida to my 

supervisor nathan basiliko you may think it was a huge inconvenience to get me to ship up and 

move to sudbury when you switched universities but i’m glad you did i have enjoyed my time 

here also i appreciate how lucky i was to experience the rare opportunity of having both 

supervisors nate basiliko and john caspersen visit the field with me i enjoyed hearing about the 

professor perspective on academia and publishing while we were sampling cwd and soils all 

while i was admiring their seemingly supernatural bug tolerance i would also like to thank 

genevieve noyce for sampling assistance and for remembering where i was the entire time we 

were in the field also many thanks to phil rudz who initially showed me how to identify 

decay stages without kara webster dave morris rob fleming and paul hazlett at cfs i 

would not have had the chance to work on the island lake sites they are a beautiful 

experimental set up and i was very lucky to get a chance to work there also i’d like to 

acknowledge stephanie wilson for completing my microbial biomass assays and teaching me 

how to conduct large scale enzyme assays and sir at cfs this research was funded by 

nserc crd with industrial support from tembec inc and community partners of the 

northeast superior regional chief’s forum and the northeast superior forest communities

general introduction 
 

in a society where answers to most questions can be found literally in ones hand and 

travelling across the world in a day is possible the perception of our world has shifted to one 

decidedly smaller than generations past it becomes easy to forget that these luxuries have an 

energetic cost energy unfortunately derived from mostly non renewable resources in an 

environment of continual population growth these energy demands rise the impacts wrought 

from global climate change and the anticipated future scarcity of oil resources with high 

environmental costs of extraction have engaged global attention and encouraged exploration of 

alternative energy sources to meet these rising energy demands antoni et al berch et al 

 dorian et al bioenergy is just one of the potential avenues for future exploitation 

agriculture and forestry are the main sources of the biomass for bioenergy production the low 

frequency of harvesting disturbance and the lengthy growth cycle in forestry systems is 

considered by some to be more sustainable than conventional agricultural operations as a 

possible source of bioenergy production agricultural operations are known to advance soil 

degradation processes and damage watersheds hoogwijk stonehouse bohl 

stupak et al tilman et al werhahn mees et al forestry practices are also 

less likely to exacerbate food shortage many commercial forestry operations occur on lands 

unsuitable to agriculture dorian et al puddister et al stupak et al 

although there is a long history of bioenergy production in the forestry sector bioenergy in 

north american forestry operations is rarely the primary product of interest energy is generated 

onsite from wood residues and black liquor that are otherwise unusable for sawmill and pulping 

operations hoogwijk as tree boles are a valuable commodity for saw and pulpwood it 

is more likely enhanced bioenergy production in the forestry sector will be supported by 

feedstocks derived from tree residues that are not typically removed e g tree tops small 

branches stumps residues can be used to produce energy directly through combustion or can 

be converted to ethanol and other petroleum substitutes through various chemical and biological 

mechanisms hoogwijk janowiak webster 



 

 

incentives for intensifying biomass removal 

the idea of using woody biomass for centralized energy production is not a novel 

concept chemical recovery boilers have been in operation since the ’s at pulp mills and 

various operations utilize bark or sawmill wastes for direct combustion or for the production of 

wood pellets which can then be converted to thermal energy off site hoogwijk sabourin 

et al stupak et al tenenbaum also the potential for wood biomass as an 

energy source is substantial wood derived electrical energy in the us is predicted to rise to 

billion kwh by energy information administration in canada heating during 

winter is often partially or fully supported through non centralized biomass combustion for 

many households wood biomass could be a greater constituent of the total energy budget 

currently forestry supplies of canada’s energy supply but this is expected to rise natural 

resources canada 

harvesting solely for the purpose of producing biomass is not economically viable for 

most forest systems smeets faaij however the increasing energy demands and the 

goal of reduced reliance on fossil fuels create incentives for forest management to utilize 

materials they would otherwise leave on site in short there is now increased possibility of profit 

from intensified harvesting practices this trend of intensified harvesting has begun in the boreal 

forests of canada where some operations are moving to whole tree from stem only harvests 

 myketa et al the effects of these different harvesting methods have not been 

extensively investigated in the unique boreal ecosystem and so the impacts upon ecosystem 

processes must be studied though canadian operations have thus far been restricted to whole 

tree harvests in europe intensified biomass removal in softwood and mixed wood forests can be 

so extreme as to involve stump and root removal and removal of forest floor i e organic rich 

surface litters and soil lindroos 

forests as global carbon stores 

the importance of forests to the global biosphere and atmosphere warrants careful study 

and understanding of the vital ecological processes that occur within them greenhouse gas 

derived global warming has brought attention to the value of forests as global long term carbon 

stores and this has been reflected in the literature birdsey et al nunery keeton 

smeets faaij in previous studies of high intensity harvesting systems a gradient of c 



 

 

sequestration ability has been seen with lower carbon pools in the higher intensity systems 

 nunery keeton this range of carbon storage may be attributed to the amount of 

downed woody debris dwd allotted to each of these systems dwd contains both large 

downed woody debris greater than cm diameter cwd and smaller diameter fine woody 

debris fwd since cwd is highly variable between different forests the actual contribution to 

the carbon storage capabilities of a given forest can range from of the above ground 

carbon storage laiho prescott intensified harvesting practices can reduce the 

subsurface carbon storage capabilities of forest systems as well a recent study by clemmensen 

et al showed that mycorrhizal fungi are responsible for a large portion of carbon storage 

in the mineral soils of boreal forests in intensified systems these mycorrhizal networks could be 

damaged by stump removal or mycorrhizal survivorship might suffer with fewer dwd residues 

to provide refuges for these organisms during high stress events such as drought or forest fire 

 harmon et al kauserud et al lehto zwiazek it is important to monitor 

these systems to understand the implications of intensified biomass removal in a variety of 

ecosystems despite the risks of losing a portion of ecosystem level c stocks via soil organic 

matter and dwd intensified biomass harvesting in forest systems might remain a desirable 

option for bioenergy production particularly when compared to agricultural options 

ecological functions of coarse woody debris 

the value of forests extends far past their carbon storage capabilities forests remain 

hotspots of biodiversity in an increasingly urbanized and agriculturally dominated world 

landscape canada is lucky in that we have the largest intact forest in the world the northern 

boreal forest though this area has of yet remained largely undeveloped mining industries have 

begun to encroach on this territory and if future markets for wood residues increase it may 

become plausible for logging operations to move into these areas currently however logging 

operations are restricted to the southern portion of canada natural resources canada b 

biodiversity has already been impacted in these areas by the introduction of roads noise and 

other types of disturbance introduced by logging operations in order to decrease the 

extensiveness of these impacts different tiers of biodiversity need to be characterized and 

observed in the face of intensified harvesting cwd is known to be an important resource in 

forest systems contributing habitat and nutrients to the forest floor in fact the importance of 

this resource is so great that accepted sustainable management systems attempt to ensure the 



 

 

maintenance of these ecosystem functions by designating specific levels of woody residues to be 

left on site after harvest stupak et al vanderwel 

nutritional contributions to forest soils 

moving past “stem only” harvesting introduces the issue of reduced nutrient pools from 

loss of nutrient rich litter inputs such as leaves and needles as well as fwd that has a 

proportionally large amount of nutrient rich bark loss of these important nutrient sources could 

have potential to reduce future forest regeneration capabilities thiffault et al werhahn 

mees et al the nutritional contribution of cwd to the landscape consists mostly of 

carbon and calcium but also minor amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus harmon et al 

laiho prescott spears holub the flux of nitrogen and phosphorus in cwd is 

dynamic and greatly influenced by its resident biotic community nitrogen and phosphorus 

concentrations change as cwd decays and this is likely due to a combination of leaching 

fragmentation and active transport by fungi harmon et al laiho prescott 

fungi have many unique adaptations allowing them to persist in environments that should be 

unsuitable to their survival rhizomorphs allow fungi to not only persist but flourish in some of 

these environments these thick masses of hyphae can transport water and limiting nutrients 

from surrounding environments to the actively growing portion of the mycelial network and 

similarly mycelia can transport nutrients albeit over smaller distances boddy watkinson 

 lehto zwiazek marjanovic nehls the transport of water and 

extraneous nutrients allow fungi to make cwd suitable as a growth medium and carbon 

substrate by other organisms this transformation of woody material to a moist more nutrient 

rich environment also allows bacteria to act on wood tissues and further release nutrients from 

wood cell components boddy watkinson fransson et al bacterial presence in 

wood tissues may also allow for another source of nitrogen to enter cwd nitrogen fixed directly 

from the atmosphere it is not known whether nitrogen input through bacterial fixation is a 

significant source of nitrogen for forests this activity could possibly be a contributor of 

nitrogen as nitrogen fixing activity has been reported in cwd residues brunner kimmins 

 



 

 

biodiversity maintenance 

habitat functions of dwd include shelter mating habitat and food resources these 

functions are important to various plant and animal species dispersed among the various stages 

of decay and are directly related to the degradation of dwd by microorganisms botting 

delong langor et al maser et al mccay komoroski mengak 

guynn the removal of cwd specifically has been demonstrated to reduce diversity of 

organisms in some intensely managed forest systems in europe berch et al the various 

stages of decay represent a spectrum of characteristics early decay features wood residues that 

are rigid solid low in nitrogen and phosphorus and only utilized by some insects and 

insectivores as food later stages of decay are higher in moisture have much more structural 

instability and contain hollow spaces along with elevated levels of phosphorus and nitrogen 

compared to early decay increasing the suitability of the cwd material to support a greater 

range of ecosystem functions fransson et al harmon et al maser et al 

some of these habitats are amenable to mycorrhizal fungi harmon et al juutilainen et 

al rajala et al whether they are actively using nutrients for the wood or just find 

a suitable place through which to form fruiting body structures the storage of their hyphae in is 

important survival of ectomycorrhizae in cwd after disturbance events may assist in successful 

tree re establishment kauserud et al lehto zwiazek the dynamism exhibited 

by these characteristics facilitated by microorganisms changes the state of cwd to such an 

extent that the microbial community itself reflects the variation exhibited through the decay 

stages 

 recent technologies have allowed for the advancement of studies concerning microbial 

communities in the environment previous studies of fungi involved with the stepwise processes 

of wood decomposition de lignification by white rot and breakdown of celluloses and 

hemicelluloses by brown and soft rot fungi focused mostly on fruiting body prevalence or 

culture methods both of which are selective i e do not likely characterize in situ communities 

accurately and far from exhaustive allmér et al kernaghan patriquin nadkarni 

et al molecular surveys have brought forth an era where it is possible to reveal 

sequences of thousands of distinct species within a single sample most of these surveys have 

shown that this complexity is vastly underrepresented in previous culture techniques and that the 

ecology of cwd is far more complex than previously recorded with known decomposers often 



 

 

only appearing in early decay stages kubartová et al ottosson rajala et al 

 it is important to understand microbial community structure at each stage of decay within 

and between forest types that may serve keystone functions from some of the few studies that 

have employed new techniques to characterize cwd microbial communities it has been shown 

that decay stage was more important than proximity in predicting similarity between decomposer 

communities among logs kubartová et al the connection between decay class and 

community structure introduce the possibility of including biodiversity indices into established 

landscape level cwd stock prediction models eg vanderwel et al if enough 

community consistency is observed this may allow for the prediction of disturbance impacts on 

landscape level microbial diversity 

potential impacts of harvesting intensification 

intensification of forest harvesting has been shown to affect microbial community 

composition a study by hartmann et al featuring soils from full tree and stumped 

harvesting systems established between and in conifer forests across british columbia 

 western canada detected significant differences between treated and untreated sites however 

the studies were completed a considerable amount of time after harvest so the effectiveness of 

microbial community as an indicator of early disturbance effects has not been examined also 

the inherent differences that could have existed between the plots due to temporal and spatial 

variation in sampling could have influenced differences witnessed in this study hartmann et al 

 

intensified harvesting systems involve disturbances that are distinct from the impacts of 

more common stem only biomass removal intensified harvesting processes likely lead to greater 

physical soil disturbance and altered soil properties due to leaching weathering compaction and 

erosion are the main consequences of this increased exposure brown fernández et al 

 tan et al the more drastic the disturbance the more the ambient hydrological and 

nutrient dynamics are altered compaction can have a large influence on the hydrological 

characteristics of forest soils hartmann et al tan et al differences across 

increasing levels of mechanical disturbance have been observed however ultimately the natural 

heterogeneity of study sites has made these observations difficult to accurately quantify 

 hartmann et al in general there is a lack of understanding of how intensified biomass 



 

 

removal and related loss of dwd will impact both soil and wood microbial communities which 

are drivers of essential ecosystem processes and decay and related ecological succession this is 

particularly true in the context of the vast boreal forest of ontario 

study summary thesis structure and co authorship statement 

this study used a new harvest trial installation hereafter “island lake” that 

included replicated treatments of levels of intensified biomass removal from a jack pine forest 

in northern ontario this research trial provides a unique opportunity to examine short term 

disturbance effects which may have important consequences in regards to seedling survivorship 

and establishment of mycorrhizal associations inference of longer term impacts of biomass 

removal that are more likely linked to reduced slash at time of harvest required investigating 

cwd pools of various decay stage microbial communities within cwd and soil in an 

unharvested nearby old growth jack pine stand were characterized to link association of 

particular organisms decay stage and to explore linkages between cwd and underlying soils 

this may provide indications of whether important decay organisms might be lost by reducing 

future cwd pools through intensified harvesting practices to address questions of whether or 

not cwd microbial communities are specific by forest type cwd communities were also 

characterized in a contrasting sugar maple dominated great lake st lawrence forest in central 

ontario and to address if communities are species specific cwd communities were also 

characterized in a sugar maple grove of the carolinian forest of southern ontario ultimately 

this study will help discern the effect of different harvesting intensity and verify the utility of soil 

microbial communities as an indicator of environmental change it also contributed fundamental 

understanding of the diversity and role of microbial communities in wood decomposition the 

thesis comprises primarily semi stand alone manuscript style research chapters the first 

addresses soil microbial disturbance associated with biomass harvesting while the second 

focuses on cwd microbial communities these chapters are framed with this general 

introduction and a comprehensive conclusion section that revisits interrelated aspects of the 

chapters that are not covered in each alone as well as suggestions for future related work 

graduate supervisors and research colleagues nathan basiliko john caspersen kara webster 

paul hazlett and dave morris played important roles in this research and will be co authors on 

each chapter as they are submitted for consideration by scientific journals however the research 

was carried out and written up primarily by me 



 

 

research objectives and hypotheses 

 this thesis will address the impacts of biomass removal intensities on soil microbial 

structure and functioning and characterize the microbial communities within cwd across 

decay stage and forest type to allow predictions of how intensified harvesting will affect future 

levels of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning 

 project will test the following hypotheses increased biomass removal though reduced 

slash and increased physical soil disturbance will reduce soil moisture and organic matter inputs 

and thus lead to lower microbial biomass microbial degradative capabilities will also be reduced 

and microbial community structure will change with harvesting intensity the microbial 

community structure resulting from harvesting impacts is not comparable to natural fire 

disturbance project will investigate the following hypotheses community structures will 

differ based on decay stage of wood with initial stages containing fewer species likely white and 

brown rot fungi will dominate that facilitate greater diversity in fungi and bacteria for later 

decay stages by increasing and transforming available nutrients similarities exist between late 

decay communities from different environments cwd of similar species should have more 

similar microbial community compositions than that of different residue types microbial 

community structure in different locations within cwd will be different cwd of different 

decay status should have different compositions in soils beneath them due to biological and 

physical nutrient exchange with cwd above them 

 

 



 

 

chapter 
impacts of intensified harvesting on microbial community 

structure and function in boreal forest soils 
 

 introduction 

global dependence on non renewable petroleum derived energy and increasing scarcity 

of oil resources have driven the exploration of alternative energy sources as potential solutions 

for global energy needs berch et al dorian et al the forestry sector in north 

america already represents one of the largest producers of centralized bio energy and many 

companies are looking towards increasing production and marketing beyond internal utilization 

the additional demand for wood biomass encourage intensified harvesting practices that could 

impact increase levels of soil disturbance at time of harvest and future stocks of woody debris in 

forest ecosystems most current silvicultural guidelines in ontario prescribe stem only 

harvesting but nevertheless these activities are already taking place in some areas of the boreal 

forests of canada e g favouring whole tree v stem only harvests myketa et al the 

differences in ecology climate and geology could cause different responses to intensified 

biomass harvests in the unique boreal ecosystem compared to studies completed in europe and 

western canada berch et al hartmann et al 

the advancement of biomass removal past stem only harvesting can negatively influence 

biodiversity and soil nutrient pools litter such as leaves and small branches and large and 

downed coarse woody debris forest floor woody debris cm in diameter are widely 

acknowledged as an important component of forest ecosystems for habitat and nutritional 

contributions to the forest system boddy watkinson brunner kimmins 

fransson et al harmon et al lehto zwiazek tedersoo kõljalg 

thiffault et al werhahn mees et al depletion of downed fine and coarse woody 

debris dwd could reduce nitrogen phosphorus calcium and carbon inputs to soils the 

ecosystem services and strong dependence of microbial organisms on their immediate soil 

environment makes microbial community analysis a powerful indicator tool to detect soil 

disturbances from harvesting activities studies have shown altered chemical characteristics in 

soils from intensified biomass harvesting practices that could have impacts on the microbial 

ecology within forest environments thiffault et al in the literature there is a lack of 



 

 

consistency regarding the response of microbial communities to increased biomass removal past 

stem only harvest techniques used and responses vary between papers many studies have 

reported differences in microbial community structure and function between harvested and 

unharvested sites likely associated with the physical disturbances which accompany logging 

operations chatterjee et al hynes germida siira pietikäinen et al 

machinery in harvesting processes often cause compaction in soils which can alter hydrology 

and nutrient dynamics busse beattie hartmann et al janowiak webster 

 lower resolution technologies e g risa plfa did not observe community changes 

from biomass removal past stem only harvesting excepting the most extreme scenario of 

complete organic matter removal hannam et al kataja aho et al mariani et al 

 no response of microbial communities to biomass removal intensification in these studies 

could have been due to the low resolution of techniques applied a study by hartmann et al 

 using high throughput sequencing saw distinct clustering of communities from forest 

soils exposed to different levels of organic material removal few studies have investigated the 

impacts of intensified biomass removals in short term scenarios this time frame is important as 

seedlings are typically planted quickly after harvests occur reductions of plant symbionts and 

microorganisms important to nutrient cycling functions in soils that could occur from intensified 

biomass removal would have the potential to inhibit seedling establishment kernaghan 

patriquin lehto zwiazek tedersoo et al the detection of community 

responses to intensified biomass harvesting in higher resolution molecular techniques where 

more coarse techniques have failed as well as the lack of work investigating the short term 

implications of these management decisions suggest that the impacts of intensified biomass 

harvesting upon microbial diversity in forest soils requires additional study before 

generalizations can be applied 

microbial communities in ontario boreal forest soils need to be investigated in the short 

term time frames involved in planting after harvest this timescale has not been extensively 

studied due to the age of existing study sites and the previous expense associated with the 

advanced molecular techniques typically used to study microbial communities it is anticipated 

that the increased intensity harvesting will reduce soil moisture and microbial biomass through 

reduction of slash and increased physical disturbance microbial degradative capabilities will 

change with harvesting intensity microbial community structure will change with increased 



 

 

harvesting intensity and microbial community structure in naturally disturbed sites will not 

reflect the changes which occur from harvesting disturbance due to the different amount and 

mechanism of soil organic losses in fire disturbance compared to harvesting disturbance 

 methods 

 study site 

 the island lake site was located near chapleau ontario in the ontario shield ecozone 

 lake abitibi boreal ecoregion of ontario prior to harvesting in the site consisted of ca 

 year old jack pine pinus banksiana monoculture planted in the early to mid s the 

landscape was relatively flat with minimal slope and so was relatively uniformly distributed 

across the landscape prior to harvesting soils were generally sandy and acidic belonging to the 

brunisolic order there were four applied treatments bladed which consisted of removal of all 

biomass and lfh layer from the plot stumped where the full tree and stumps were removed 

from the plot full tree where the entirety of each tree upwards from the stump was removed 

from the plot and tree length where only the bole of each tree was removed and the stumps and 

upper branches were left on site after harvest five replicates of each biomass harvesting 

intensity were performed on randomly distributed plots within the treatment area and five control 

plots were placed within an unharvested area bordering the treatment plots each plot was m 

and one half of each treatment plot was planted with jack pine and the other black spruce picea 

mariana and each sub plot split again and one half treated with glyphosate to suppress broadleaf 

plant growth chapleau receives an annual average of mm of precipitation a year and has an 

average yearly temperature range of to °c a nearby old growth stand predominately of 

jack pine that has not burned in ca y based on ages of most mature trees was also sampled 

and this was the site where was sampled local name “nimitz” although the old growth 

controls were not included in the randomized replicated experimental design the five replicate 

sampling locations were spaced up to km apart and thus might still be suitably comparable to 

the main treatment and control plots to explore harvesting impacts as opposed to other between 

site differences a nearby fire site consisting of a year old jack pine stand that experienced a 

burn in was added to the study in the sampling plots in the fire site were 

established approximately km apart 



 

 

 sampling 

soils were sampled in control old growth tree length full tree stumped and bladed sites 

june th th during june th st sampling was repeated for all control tree 

length full tree and stumped treatments as well as two bladed treatments and all plots of the 

fire site cm mineral soil cores and lfh grab samples were taken from six points along two 

cross sections of each plot for each herbicide and non herbicide treatment on the flats within 

the site the areas with minimal physical disturbance in fire sites samples were taken along 

the approximate mid point of each site these samples were then pooled mixed and stored at 

 °c at the earliest convenience samples were processed in the lab by sieving through a mm 

sieve to homogenize the samples and remove any large debris a small portion of soil was frozen 

without sieving for molecular tests 

 laboratory methods 

 substrate induced respiration 

substrate induced respiration was performed using the microresp™ system as 

referenced in bérard et al sieved soil samples were used to fill well deepwell plates 

deepwell plates were incubated at room temperature for days for lfh samples and days for 

mineral soils substrates were prepared so that applied solutions would result in concentrations 

of approximately mg per gram soil water given application of a µl aliquot clear well 

plates were prepared with agar containing cresol red kcl and nahco the indicator in the 

agar underwent a detectable colorimetric change upon acidification when exposed to co 

indicator plates were secured over the deepwell plates and incubated at room temperature for 

hours after application of substrate solutions substrates utilized were alanine glucose 

arabinose butyrate arginine ketose citrate oxalate cysteine maltose fructose and trehalose 

plate absorbance was read with a spectrophotometer microplate reader at nm 

 enzyme assays 

 hydrolase assay 

hydrolase assays were completed using a method based on that of hassett zak 

stock µm solutions were made for mub β d glucopyranoside mub β d cellobioside 

mub phosphate mub n acetyl β d glucosaminide and mub standard the mub standard 



 

 

was diluted to µm g of sieved soil were measured and blended with ml of m 

sodium acetate buffer for minute the sample was agitated in a petri plate and µl were 

aliquotted into a black well microplate substrates were loaded into the microplate plates 

were incubated in the dark at room temperature for minutes fluorescence was measured at an 

excitation of nm and an emission wavelength of nm 

 lignase assay 

lignase activity was determined in a manner similar to hassett zak fresh 

 m l dopa solution was used as a substrate for lignase activity measurement ml of 

 m sodium acetate buffer was blended with g of sieved soil the sample was agitated in a 

petri plate and µl were aliquotted into a clear well microplate substrates were loaded 

into the microplate in µl volumes plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 

 minutes absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer microplate reader at nm 

 chloroform fumigation 

sieved sampled were used to analyze microbial biomass generally following basiliko et 

al soil moisture was measured by subtraction of dry weight from wet weight samples 

were weighed to g dry weight for lfh and g dry weight for mineral soil m k so 

solution was used as a blank two sets of samples for each soil sample were made one set of 

samples was fumigated with chloroform and the other set was left untreated the chloroform 

fumigated samples were placed in a desiccator with a ml beaker containing ml 

chloroform and boiling chips a vacuum was applied to the desiccator until the chloroform had 

boiled for minutes the samples were then left to fumigate for hours with a garbage bag 

over the desiccator volumes of ml of m k so were added to the unfumigated samples 

and blanks and incubated at room temperature with shaking for hour after chloroform 

fumigation the amount of chloroform remaining in the beaker was measured and samples were 

evacuated under vacuum for hours mineral samples were gravity filtered with e filters 

lfh samples were vacuum filtered and then fine filtered samples were stored at °c until 
processing

 results 

there was a striking difference in environmental conditions between and the 

average temperature in was almost °c higher than with this trend being present 

throughout the year there was mm more precipitation in compared to the 

sampling period in was drier than the sampling week having mm of precipitation 

compared to the mm of precipitation in the sampling the average temperature for 

 sampling days was °c higher than the dates in environment canada it was 

visually obvious that there was more low stature vegetation biomass in the harvested sites during 

the second sampling year compared to the first sampling year blueberry was prominent in the 

harvested and fire sites whereas moss dominated the understory in control and old growth sites 

vegetation was generally less prevalent in herbicide treated sites but did not contain significantly 

different microbial consortia 

 soil chemistry and microbial biomass 

chemical characteristics of soils sampled in were different between mineral and 

lfh soil horizons figure when subsets of data by layer were considered there were 

important differences in control sites compared to treatments in the lfh layer figure in 

mineral soils the difference between control and treatment soils was generally not present 

except that bladed sites had different amounts of total extractable ions than other treatments 

 figure microbial biomass in control sites and old growth lfh soils was on average higher 

than that of soils in harvest treatment plots and this difference was significant between old 

growth sites and all treatments figure microbial biomass was also higher in control mineral 

soils though not significantly different from all harvesting treatments figure 



 

 

 t rflp based microbial richness and diversity 

t rflp based archaeal richness and diversity from soils sampled in were not 

significantly different between treatments though they appeared to be increasing in mineral soils 

with disturbance intensification figures in appendix table these patterns were not 

present in and there was again no significant effect of harvesting bacterial community 

richness from soils sampled in was only significantly different between old growth mineral 

and bladed mineral sites figures in appendix table there were no within year significant 

differences between richness or diversity for bacteria in samples collected or for fungi in 

samples collected either or 

 microbial community structure and functioning 

the impacts of intensified biomass removal harvesting though visually quite extreme in 

the field did not appear to have an effect on community composition in soils sampled in 

 figures in appendix there was a general harvesting impact on community structure in year 

 months after treatments were implemented where harvested lfh soils were different from 

control and fire sites figure 

archaeal bacterial and fungal communities as characterized with t rflp analyses 

significantly differed based on sampling year table overall t rflp community 

composition was also significantly different between soil horizons in and figure 

table the significant differences in mineral soils were generally between the old 

growth forest site and the island lake harvest treatment sites figure in appendix table 

communities in the lfh control and old growth soils appeared to be different from 

harvested sites which could have driven the significant differences between the clusters figure 

in appendix table the metabolic profiles in mineral horizons of soils sampled in 

were different between control samples and all harvest treatments regardless of biomass 

removal intensity and control sites were clustered more closely than other treatments indicating 

greater heterogeneity in microbial functioning after disturbance figure in appendix 

strangely microbial functioning in old growth and bladed sites seemed to be more similar to 

each other than other treatments figure in appendix controls had more variability in lfh 

horizons compared to mineral soils perhaps due to the higher potential for moisture and nutrient 

fluctuations in lfh horizon because of increased contact with mosses and external environment 



 

 

compared to mineral horizon soil figure figure in appendix differences between 

harvested and unharvested sites were more apparent in lfh soils where old growth and control 

soils had more variation and ordinated differently than harvest treatments figure though 

community differences were significant between mineral samples these differences were 

not strongly represented with ordination figure table in lfh soils however 

significant differences in community structure were observed with control and fire sites 

clustering separately from tree length and stumped sites figure table herbicide 

application did not significantly alter microbial community structure within mineral or lfh soils 

 table 

pyrotag sequencing did not reveal strong universal differences in communities with 

harvesting intensity however some differences between harvested treatments and the fire and 

control sites were apparent in the fungal communities and between fire and bladed treatments 

from other samples in bacterial communities figure figure distributions of unique 

taxa were also investigated across treatments and controls fire and bladed sites appeared to have 

quite a few indicator species that were not present in other treatments figure however 

fungal communities were similar amongst the various treatments excepting control fire and 

bladed samples in which unique otu distributions appeared to be present figure 

 species associated with harvesting treatments 

otus that were found to be significantly associated to one or more treatments using 

indicator species analysis were regarded as indicator species most bacterial indicator species 

were of very low abundance less than of total community composition figure figure 

 fungal indicator species were of similarly low abundance figure figure though 

all bacterial indicator species were of low abundance several bradyrhizobiaceae and 

hyphomicrobiaceae indicator species were associated with lfh soils in tree length and fire 

treatments figure in lfh soils the highest abundance of many indicator species were in 

fire sites figure table many fungal indicator species in mineral soils had higher 

abundance with bladed stumped and control treatments as opposed to bacterial associations with 

tree length full tree and stumped treatments figure figure fungal indicator species in 

lfh soils varied greatly in abundance with several otus being indicative of control plot 

conditions and several responding to the fire disturbance figure the fungal otus 



 

 

 and were identified as belonging to known ectomycorrhizal genera 

hygrophorus russula and piloderma table many of otus that had larger differences in 

abundance were more heterotrophic organisms such as basidioascus infundilicybe 

mycogloeae pseudoomphalina hygrophorus and piloderma were also higher abundance in 

control site lfh soils also in mineral soils a chytrid fungus had elevated abundance within 

bladed sites figure some ascomycete species were elevated in fire sites the phylogeny of 

both fungal and bacterial indicator species was not effectively delineated most likely because 

erroneous otu identification due to database insufficiencies prevented effective sequence 

alignment jeraldo et al 

 discussion 

microbial communities often respond quickly to disturbance and can be used as 

indicators of ecosystem functioning and response to stressors blazewicz et al evans 

wallenstein osborn smith however as seen in this study sometimes 

community structure changes take longer than anticipated the lack of community structure 

differences between lfh soils of intensified harvesting treatments may have been because 

components of woody debris were not yet being incorporated in sufficiently different amounts or 

microbial communities had not had sufficient time to respond to different levels of inputs 

alternatively the microbial communities may have just been resilient of resistant to the gradient 

of disturbance provided allison martiny shade et al werner et al 

leachates from cwd change as wood decays which occurs over a period of years kruys et al 

 rudz spears lajtha spears holub metabolic responses may 

have been more responsive to short term changes as metabolic adaptations occur on a faster time 

scale in response to smaller differences than required for large scale changes to community 

structure allison martiny shade et al it may be that the between harvesting 

treatment differences could emerge in future years as has been seen in other studies or they 

could remain undetectable which has also been observed in intensified systems albeit with 

functional assays or low resolution molecular techniques busse beattie hartmann et 

al kataja aho et al mariani et al tan et al though short term 

differences were not as apparent soil differences could emerge as cwd leachates change 

underlying soil chemistry as the leachates from remaining residues change with decay spears 

holub 



 

 

 harvesting impacts on biomass moisture and microbial 
community function 

the differences in microbial metabolic activity seen in lfh soil horizons between 

control sites and harvest treatments might have been driven by concomitant changes in soil 

chemical properties also due to harvesting figure figure the lower enzymatic and 

respiration activities in harvested lfh horizons could be ultimately explained by the higher 

biomass of the controls compared to harvested sites frankenberger dick li et al 

 liu et al in contrast to the mineral horizon the difference between control and 

harvested lfh horizon soils corresponded to lowered enzyme activities rather than the ability to 

utilize specific substrates enzyme quantity was changing with harvesting rather than the suite of 

enzymes being utilized figure the reduction of active vegetative material after harvesting 

disturbance could have contributed to this as root exudates in the rhizosphere are known to 

modulate microbial activities and promote growth of microorganisms garbaye van hees 

et al kuzyakov orr et al the harvested sites were equivalently barren of 

vegetation when enzyme analyses were completed so perhaps the lack of vegetation in 

comparison to control plots was the main influence on microbial metabolic functioning the 

difference between control and harvested mineral horizons was mostly based on respiration of 

sugars and amino acids these nutrients would be more abundant in the rhizosphere environment 

that was reduced in harvested sites huang et al kuzyakov the increased 

exposure of plots to wind may have also been contributing to the change in microbial 

functioning increased oxygen availability in soils could change nutrition strategies of 

microorganisms present in soils if fewer anaerobic microenvironments were present in soils 

 fukuda kimball lemon picek et al wang et al the physical 

disturbance associated with harvesting may have exacerbated these impacts as well existing 

research has shown that increased physical disturbance of soils created noticeable effects on 

microbial community functioning chatterjee et al mariani et al schnurr pütz et 
al tan et al it is quite surprising then that stumped soils which experienced 

additional upheaval and mixing of soils were not distinct from less intensive full tree and tree 

length harvesting figure figure kataja aho et al though working in a different 

boreal system also did not see stumping impacts in this case it seems that even the visually 

distinct plots that result from the intensification of clear cut harvesting do not have sufficient 

plot level variation to produce functionally distinct microbial consortium despite this a clear 



 

 

difference between the functional characteristics of unharvested and harvested sites was 

observed it may be that the already biomass intensive clear cut management systems is less 

impacted by further biomass extractions in comparison to less extreme harvesting regimes such 

as selection and shelterwood systems 

 microbial community structure doesn’t respond noticeably to 
intensification of clearcut harvesting on short term time scales 

considering that others have found significant chemical differences in soils between 

different levels of intensified harvests it was odd that there weren’t differences between 

microbial communities in the island lake sites thiffault et al in general there were 

some differences in microbial community structure between all harvest treatments and the 

control and sometimes old growth sites but not clear differences among harvest intensity in 

lfh horizons figure figure community structure shifts from harvesting have been 

documented in other systems chatterjee et al hynes germida mummey et al 

 siira pietikäinen et al this could indicate that a broader environmental change 

 e g warmer temperatures lack of living vegetation or both across all harvest treatments was 

more important than subtler differences among biomass removal intensity treatments 

communities generally respond to vegetation differences as some bacterial and fungal species 

participate in specific mutualistic associations with plants huang et al kernaghan 

patriquin morton et al also general heterotrophic soil microorganisms can be 

influenced by the root exudates that accompany live vegetation huang et al kuzyakov 

 microbial communities respond to the physical disturbances introduced during harvesting 

as well busse beattie mariani et al schnurr pütz et al tan et al 
changes in microbial communities with harvest intensity may occur in an extended timeframe 

as has been seen in other systems with system intensification busse beattie hartmann 

et al there is some indication that the lag in response could have been because of drier 

hotter conditions that occurred during i e a regional climate anomaly overrode treatment 

effects sampling as there was an increase in community richness and diversity for all kingdoms 

assayed between and though this was not consistent across all treatments figures in 

appendix both brockett et al and evans wallenstein described influences 

of soil moisture and climate on microbial community characteristics which could have 

exacerbated temporal differences between and samples it did appear that soil 



 

 

chemical concentrations were driving some of these inter annual differences in community 

structure for example with corresponding differences in both soil chemistry and community 

structure in the year of figure figure why these differences were constrained to the 

lfh horizon is debatable this could have been due to underlying chemical differences as were 

seen in soil analyses the soil analyses showed dissimilarity of mineral soil chemistry 

was due in part to polysaccharide concentrations perhaps leachates from lfh layers had not 

changed considerably within the year between sampling figure it was strange that this study 

has not found large differences in microbial community structures between harvesting 

treatments considering that these effects have been witnessed in recent molecular studies 

 hartmann et al intensified harvesting impacts have been reported in different forest 

systems but not consistently and within large dispersed plots in which natural heterogeneity 

could have influenced results and without a complete gradient of removal treatments hannam 

et al mariani et al the lack of difference was likely not because of the relatively 

low resolution of t rflp analyses compared to the high throughput techniques employed in 

hartmann et al as treatment effects were not clear in pyrotag sequencing data either 

 figure figure this lack of response could also just be a characteristic of the boreal 

environment the colder climate generally causes ecological processes to occur on longer time 

scales and other boreal studies have seen a similar lack of difference kataja aho et al 

mariani et al smith et al when otus responsible for site differences were 

examined there appeared to be slight differences in microbial communities from which otus 

were found which could presumably become more apparent over time figure figure it 

may be that the plot design has accounted for natural variation within plots in the island lake 

sites where other studies may have issues related to spatial variations corresponding with 

treatment variations hannam et al smith et al it is more likely that the time 

between sampling and treatment was insufficient for effects to emerge as they have in studies 

completed in longer time frames hartmann et al the relatively short time since slash 

input could have impacted residue leachate emissions into soils as leachates from wood have 

been reported as lower in early decay stages compared to later decay stages hafner et al 

rudz the short term effects investigated in this study may explain the lack of result 

which may be of greater interest to the forestry industry in relation to the impact of intensified 

harvesting on important plant symbionts the abundance of indicator species were low and 

possible fungal symbiont taxa were not responding differentially between harvesting treatments 



 

 

though all harvesting treatments had lower abundances of these species than controls figure 

table this low abundance of indicator species and lack of difference in the abundance of 

hygrophorus and piloderma between harvesting treatments may mean that from the perspective 

of establishment of plant microbial associations in soils the impact of intensified biomass 

harvests may not be much different from business as usual clear cut operations in the short term 

though bacterial indicator species in mineral soils were all in very low abundance it did 

not mean that these organisms lacked ecological importance bachy worden otu 

 may be one of these organisms as documented methylocystis species have been found to 

subsist on oxidative metabolism of methane and methanol table dedysh et al that 

this otu appeared to be of higher abundance within mineral soils of tree length and full tree 

systems compared to control and fire sites could mean less methane was being oxidized or that 

more methane was available in these harvesting treatments figure the loss of the trees on 

the harvested sites could mean less consistency of environmental characteristics within the 

treated sites and increased possibility for the formation of transiently waterlogged microsites in 

which anaerobic methanogenesis could occur benstead king mer roger the 

fact that two water associated fungal species a chytrid fungus and a tetrachaetum otus and 

 were found in their highest abundances within mineral soils of bladed treatments may be 

due to the same site characteristic figure figure alternatively wang et al 

noted that wind speed and thus soil ventilation with o and atmospheric ch is a key constraint 

on upland forest soil ch oxidation in the open harvested sites with a larger wind fetch soils 

were likely exposed to more ventilation surface temperature in exposed soils was likely much 

higher as well due to decreased shading from lack of trees the responses of many of the 

bacterial indicator species were inconsistent between harvesting treatments and did not follow a 

pattern associated with disturbance intensity the ecological significance of this is questionable 

as there is limited information on the metabolic activity of bacterial species and information 

relating to genera is often non specific and sometimes not applicable to all species within that 

genera blazewicz et al hirsch et al madsen philippot et al 

the low abundance of fungal indicator species emphasized the lack of large community 

differences observed with both t rflp and pyrotag sequencing based analyses other studies 

have also seen negligible effects of additional biomass removal as compared to stem only 

harvesting on soil fungi though the methods used were less discriminant than the ones applied in 



 

 

this study and included fungi as a portion of overall changes in microbial community chatterjee 

et al kataja aho et al this is contrary to the findings of hartmann et al 

where fungal community structure was more impacted by harvesting practices than bacterial 

community structure unlike bacterial indicator species it did seem that taxonomy was related to 

the responsiveness of these organisms to particular treatments basidiomycetes appear to be have 

higher abundance in controls versus ascomycetes which had higher abundances in disturbed 

sites though their abundances in all harvested and fire treatments were inconsistent it is possible 

that the basidiomycete otu’s were representing organisms associated with living plants this 

was particularly true of otu hygrocybe a symbiont of moss cantrell lodge 

the ascomycete species may have been adapted to disturbances and were responding to specific 

stressed niches in which they were more competitive that these changes were all occurring in 

the rare biosphere may be due to sensitive organisms in the rare biosphere responding to small 

changes more quickly than larger community components bachy worden otus 

likely representing ectomycorrhizae were more abundant in control sites figure this was 

most likely because of the distinct absence of plant life in harvested sites and thus inhospitable 

environment for these organisms in harvested soils 

 clear cut harvesting as an analog for fire disturbance 

the different community compositions in lfh horizons between fire sites and harvesting 

treatments could have been from communities adapting to the transformed and reduced amount 

of organic material by fire exposure figure that the abundance of some hyphomicrobiaceae 

and bradyrhizobiaceae species was higher in fire sites compared to control and harvest plots 

suggests that there could be some plant symbionts involved in fire succession that are not 

stimulated by harvesting perhaps because of the differences between the organic losses as well 

as forms of organic matter in fire sites compared to harvested ones generally it does not seem 

as though fire characteristics were reflected in the biota of harvested environments as there were 

several otus that were only detected in fire samples figure there could be specific 

interactions occurring between these unidentified otus and fire adapted plant species hart et 

al also the generally heterotrophic nature of most of the fire related organisms may 

provide nutrient recycling functions through microbial degradation of remaining fire transformed 

carbon and nutrient sources that would be otherwise unavailable for biological use gonzález 

pérez et al knicker mataix solera et al the otus present were likely as 



 

 

yet unidentified fire adapted species utilizing the small amount of organic material remaining in 

lfh layers after the fire event or species that were taking advantage of the rhizosphere 

environment of the vegetation present in the fire sites denison kiers huang et al 

 mataix solera et al from the perspective of soil microbiological characteristics 

clear cut harvesting did not produce a similar ecological impact as fire disturbance though the 

similar levels forest fragmentation introduced by these two disturbance types has been used as 

justification for clear cut harvesting management systems bergeron et al gluck 

rempel suffling et al there may be important ecological implications related to 

differences in microbial characteristics as these organisms could be important in successional 

plant dynamics and plant diversity bever et al van der heijden et al reynolds et 

al 

 conclusion 

though microbiological properties of harvested and unharvested systems differ 

intensifying the harvesting process did not seem to further cause additional disruptions to 

microbial community structure and function despite the obvious physical disruptions that occur 

in intensified harvesting processes there were some indications that changes will emerge in 

time as patterns existed between controls and treatments and between sampling years also 

some microbial otus even if relatively rare were responding to treatment differences perhaps 

these small changes will not impact plant community establishment in the short term as there 

was possibility for functional redundancy in the system which could be present in the largely 

unaffected community composition it was also apparent that microbial community structures 

resulting from clear cut treatments were distinctly different from those of natural fire 

disturbance the activity and ecology of fire adapted microbes need to be more thoroughly 

investigated in order to effectively determine the ecological implications of these differences 

nevertheless many forests have clear cut management regimes and although changes within 

microbial communities with intensified biomass removal do not appear to be a short term 

phenomenon long term effects may still occur and could have serious impacts on long term soil 

function and productivity should intensification be implemented to begin to address this 

potential issue in the next chapter i investigate microbial communities across a longer term

chapter 
coarse woody debris microbial community dynamics in boreal 

hardwood and temperate mixedwood forests 
 

 introduction 

global dependence on non renewable energy sources is driving research into bioenergy 

 berch et al dorian et al whether through combustion of raw biomass and 

processing byproducts or from biomass derived ethanol created in fermentation systems there is 

potential for the forestry industry to provide some of the biomass derived energy that may 

replace non renewable sources hoogwijk janowiak webster ladanai 

vinterbäck stupak et al some modification of harvesting practices in canada has 

already occurred e g favouring whole tree v stem only harvests and there is potential for some 

of the higher intensity systems employed in europe such as stumping and blading to move into 

canada should the process become profitable berch et al lindroos rämö et al 

 tenenbaum the impacts of reduced woody debris pools must be studied in boreal 

and north temperate forest ecosystems where these harvesting systems might be employed 

different stages of decayed downed coarse woody debris cwd woody debris on the 

forest floor with a diameter greater than cm are recognized as such important components of 

the forest ecosystem that sustainable management systems aim to maintain cwd input levels to 

ensure appropriate levels of each decay class will be available in the future stupak et al 

vanderwel cwd serves as habitat for many plants vertebrate animals and invertebrates 

 botting delong harmon et al jönsson et al langor et al maser 

et al mccay komoroski mengak guynn riffell et al the 

function of cwd as reservoirs of fungal diversity can allow survival of important microbial 

groups such as ectomycorrhizae through disturbances such as fire and drought this can then 

enhance seedling establishment boddy heilmann clausen harmon et al 

kauserud et al lehto zwiazek stenlid et al the characteristics that 

provide such varied environments through the decay process are related to the microbial 

community that utilizes and transforms cwd residues harmon et al laiho prescott 

 maser et al 



 

 

 molecular surveys are beginning to illustrate that the diversity of wood decomposers is 

vast e g with thousands of unique fungal taxa involved in decomposition of a single wood 

species and their ecology is complex with the “known” decomposers appearing primarily in 

early decay stages only jönsson et al kubartová et al prewitt et al many 

of these saprobic and necrotrophic fungi have host specificity to particular species of wood 

which tend to contain unique microbial communities freschet et al prewitt et al 

it seems as though the source of these organisms may not be from adjacent wood as decay stage 

rather than proximity has been shown to be a better predictor of similar decomposer 

communities among logs kubartová et al this may mean that organisms are being 

sourced from surrounding soils or from atmospheric deposition of cells if such was the case 

however harvesting history of a site should not impact microbial communities within the cwd 

pool kebli et al found different decay communities within the cwd pools of harvested 

and unharvested stands that were otherwise comparable additionally cwd decay by specific 

organisms have been studied by microscopy and has shown that the type of rots produced by 

specific fungal species vary based on which types of wood they inhabit schwarze 

different community compositions could facilitate decay through different mechanisms in 

unique environments contradictory findings between studies of cwd and unknowns pertaining 

to microbial communities within them require investigation alterations to microbial 

communities in cwd could impact decay rates and resilience of decay communities in the 

future since cwd stocks can be modeled at large spatial and temporal scales under different 

disturbance regimes vanderwel et al a finding of consistent microbial diversity across 

decay class for similar wood types in different environments would allow prediction of 

harvesting or other disturbance impacts on microbial biodiversity 

the different decay stages of wood may all be required in order to establish a healthy 

landscape scale microbial community to address questions related to how cwd microbial 

communities vary across forest region and tree species study sites were used in ontario an old 

growth boreal jack pine forest in northeastern ontario an uneven aged sugar maple dominated 

forest in the great lakes st lawrence forest region of central ontario and a sugar maple grove 

in a remnant carolinian forest in southern ontario in haliburton and chapleau microbial 

community structure was characterized in inner and outer wood samples on logs and in 

underlying soils to assess potential microbial linkages between soils and cwd it is expected 



 

 

that community structure should change as decay advances as the composition of the wood is 

different at the various stages across a particular landscape rudz fungi and bacteria may 

have a larger diversity and presence in later decay stages where the moisture and accumulated 

nutrients from hyphal sequestration might prove to be more amenable to growth as decay 

proceeds similarities between remnant materials which initially contained distinct community 

structures between different environment and residue types should emerge the gradual loss of 

bark and penetration of fungi into wood residues should also reduce within log variation due to 

spatial heterogeneity as decay advances knowledge of the microbial composition at each stage 

of decay may provide insight into whether different organisms are consistently present at each 

stage of decay both within and between forest types and if redundancy or unique organisms exist 

within the cwd pools present 

 methods 

 study sites 

 chapleau 

 the nimitz site where jack pine cwd was sampled is located near chapleau ontario in 

the ontario shield ecozone lake abitibi boreal ecoregion of ontario crins et al the 

site consisted of ca year old jack pine pinus banksiana of fire origin and natural 

regeneration the landscape was relatively flat with minimal slope and so cwd was relatively 

uniformly distributed across the landscape soils are generally sand or sandy loam textured and 

acidic belonging to the brunisolic order chapleau receives an annual average of mm of 

precipitation a year and has an average yearly temperature range of to °c 

 haliburton forest 

to compare cwd microbial communities across different forest types and regions a 

portion of the research was conducted in the haliburton forest and wildlife reserve a ha 

private woodlot in the great lakes st lawrence ecoregion of ontario canada degrees n 

 degrees w forests in the region are dominated by sugar maple acer saccharum marsh 

with secondary components of american beech fagus grandifolia ehrh yellow birch betula 

alleghaniensis britt and eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis l carriere the landscape is 

typical of the precambrian shield with rolling terrain and rock outcrops soils are generally 



 

 

quite shallow and moderately acidic dystric brunisols haliburton forest has been managed 

under single tree selection since the s and prior to that was selectively harvested high 

graded for eastern white pine pinus strobus l and yellow birch vanderwel 

haliburton receives an average annual precipitation of mm and has an average yearly 

temperature range of to °c 

 university of toronto at mississauga forest 

additional samples of one cwd decay stage matching the same species sugar maple as 

haliburton forest were taken from forest on the university of toronto at mississauga campus 

the university of toronto at mississauga is located in a forested region of mississauga ontario 

bordered by the credit river forests on the campus are dominated by sugar maple acer 

saccharum and also contain basswood tilia americana white ash fraxinus americana and 

white elm ulmus laevis the underlying soils are primarily loam textured grey brown 

luvisols with calcareous parent material b and c horizons are ph cicumneutral mississauga 

receives an average annual precipitation of mm and has an average yearly temperature range 

of to °c 

 decay classification 

defining different stages of decay works fairly well as a proxy for time this approach 

has been taken in previous studies rajala et al rudz this study assigned cwd to 

decay stages one through five using characteristics described by maser et al the 

classes move from decay class one which is relatively freshly fallen wood to decay class five 

which is extensively decayed to the point where minimal force can cause structural catastrophe 

the mid decay classes represent stages between these two extremes there has been modeling 

completed for the temporal decay of sugar maple residues in haliburton and so these modeled 

timescales were used to infer a timescale with which to associate community change rudz 

 as decay dynamics are highly variable in different environments due to differences in 

moisture temperature and wood species the chapleau data was not associated with discrete 

timescales 



 

 

 sampling 

 cwd samples were taken from the outer and inner surfaces and soil samples were taken 

from below the cwd when sampling outer samples were pried from the cwd by hand or a 

hand drill with a ¾ spade bit was used to drill the surface approximately mm of wood or bark 

tissue the inner wood sample was taken after the surface sample was removed and the shavings 

from a drill depth of approximately cm depth or deeper were collected samples from decay 

classes of and were all collected by hand as the cwd was not structurally compatible with 

drilling replicates of each decay class were collected from randomly distributed acer 

saccharum samples across haliburton forest though due to loss of identifying characteristics in 

later decay stages the identification of these wood species could be incorrect and from pinus 

banksiana residues at nimitz samples of decay class three were taken from acer saccharum 

cwd residues on the university of toronto at mississauga campus in which the inner and outer 

wood sample was pooled 

 laboratory techniques 

 dna extraction 

dna was extracted from cwd samples with the powerplant® dna isolation kit mo 

bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca there were deviations from the protocol sample

minute cycle on a tube minibeadbeater tm biospec products inc bartlesville ok 

samples were stored frozen for analysis at a later date 

 molecular analysis 

 pcr 

pcr reactions were performed in an mwg ag biotech primus thermocycler

were utilized for the amplification of bacterial s ribosomal dna fungal s ribosomal dna 

and archaeal s ribosomal dna sequences 



 

 

 t rflp 

bacterial and fungal t rflp was performed as described by preston et al t 

rflp analysis was completed at the agriculture and food laboratory in guelph university of 

guelph agriculture and food laboratory guelph on t rflp data was preprocessed in r 

using a custom function created using the algorithm described by ishii kadota senoo 

with slight modifications to accommodate the data format supplied by guelph the cutoff 

distance was set to bp and the final output was expressed as proportion total peak height per 

trf by sample kaplan kitts 

 pyrotag sequencing 

pyrotag sequencing was completed on samples collected in all replicates of a 

given harvesting regime herbicide use and type of soil were pooled and sent to mr dna where 

pyrotag sequencing was completed as per dowd et al bacterial s rdna was amplified 

with s universal eubacterial forward primer agrgtttgatcmtggctcag was used to 

amplify fragments from the bacterial s rrna gene and s universal fungal forward primer

pipeline caporaso et al data was quality filtered qiime default parameters quality 

score min length max length additional quality filtering and otu clustering 

was performed with the usearch program which utilizes the uchime algorithm to 

identify chimera sequences for removal against the gold fa dataset edgar edgar et al 

 de novo otu picking with uclust was used to form the representative otu dataset

 t rflp community analysis 

differences between t rflp microbial communities in cwd residues were compared 

using dca with the vegan package provided by r statistical software otu peaks were analyzed 

for presence absence in samples as those species that could be detected by t rflp were 

assumed to be a large component of the total microbial community r core team 

oksanen et al an adonis test using an eigenvalue method was performed to determine 



 

 

whether there were significant differences between groupings oksanen et al the 

variance explained by each factor was used to determine which subsets of data should be further

and figure construction richness and diversity were calculated in vegan relationships between 

community composition and sample physical and chemical characteristics were determined using 

an eigen value based dbrda where axis were determined using forward selection 

 results 

the three environments from which cwd were sampled were very different systems 

which was apparent upon visual inspection chapleau residues had extensive moss cover 

whereas moss cover on haliburton residues were limited to upper portions of log material and 

samples from mississauga did not feature mosses on the surfaces also in chapleau systems all 

cwd in decay classes and had extensive moss cover while moss was not present on all late 

decay class cwd residues in haliburton one of the most easily recognized differences between 

the cwd in haliburton and mississauga compared to the residues in chapleau was the increased 

presence of fungal fruiting bodies on residues on the logs sampled in this study incidences 

of fruiting bodies growing on cwd were documented in haliburton compared to only 

incidences in chapleau and incidences in mississauga residues though there may have been 

more if all decay classes were sampled wood chemistry was different between sites with 

chapleau residues having higher carbon content and lower n p k ca and mg in comparison to 

haliburton residues table however late decay wood decay class and in both sites 

showed higher levels of n p k ca and mg in comparison to early decay wood decay class 

and late decay concentrations of ca and mg were quite a bit higher in haliburton wood 



 

 

compared to chapleau wood while early concentrations were closer there could have been 

some bias in the chapleau measurements due to mass loss that were not present in the haliburton 

data rudz 

 microbial richness and diversity 

with the existing number of replicates diversity and richness were not found to be 

significantly different p between decay classes for bacterial or fungal trflp data 

there was no consistency to any patterns of diversity and richness reduction or increase through 

decay derived from t rflp data 

 community structure 

 trflp based communities 

eigen value based adonis tests of the trflp based community structure of the entirety 

of the data set indicated significant differences between the different sampling locations on each 

log as well as between the different sites table table these were visually apparent when 

investigated using detrended correspondence analysis and used to guide data subsetting in order 

to investigate more subtle community differences that could have been masked by overall trends 

 figure interestingly the community composition in mississauga residues didn’t appear to 

be more similar to haliburton residues compared to chapleau communities figure the site 

differences were present in both weighted trfs were analyzed using abundance and 

presence absence and unweighted trfs were analyzed using presence absence only datasets 

haliburton cwd did not have the significant difference between inner and outer wood 

communities that was present in chapleau samples table table the sites were also 

different in that patterns in chapleau cwd communities were more apparent in weighted 

datasets whereas patterns in haliburton communities were more apparent in unweighted 

datasets adonis tests revealed significant differences between decay classes in chapleau outer 

wood surface communities haliburton wood communities and both haliburton and chapleau 

soil communities table table however only wood communities not soil were visually 

distinct upon investigation with dca figure figure 



 

 

 pyrotag sequencing communities 

dca of bacterial pyrotag sequencing communities revealed separation based on site as 

well as decay status figure many of the bacterial otus specific to early decay were site 

specific otus as well figure consistent with the t rflp approach similarities between 

chapleau and mississauga bacterial communities were stronger than those between mississauga 

and haliburton figure fungal pyrotag sequencing revealed a similar trend though less 

distinct there wasn’t nearly as much difference between chapleau fungal communities and 

haliburton communities figure there were still site specific otus that caused minor 

differentiation between haliburton and chapleau but site specificity of otus did not relate to 

decay most otus in the ordination were specific to early decay or generalists which were 

present in all decay stages figure 

 indicator species 

many bacterial indicator species species found to be significantly associated with a 

particular decay status through indicator species analysis were of very low average relative 

abundance abundance were present in late decay but not early decay in both haliburton 

and chapleau cwd there was also a similar increase in abundance of otu in late decay 

samples abundance some otu’s only seemed to be important in one residue type otu 

 was almost of the bacterial community composition of haliburton residues but was 

almost absent in chapleau communities figure figure the family acidobacteriaceae 

as a group were a higher proportion of the bacterial community in chapleau wood otus within 

the acidobacteriaceae appeared to have different decay specificities at least in chapleau 

residues and appear to be associated with late decay whereas 

 and represent a higher proportion of total community in early and mid decay 

 figure table 

most fungal indicator species were found in early decay some of these otus were large 

components of the total fungal community the main indicator species in haliburton were 

represented by two otus and that represented averages of and of the 

total fungal community figure the most abundant indicator species in chapleau samples 

was represented by otu which was of the total fungal community figure otus 



 

 

 and were not identified effectively but was identified as belonging to the genus 

cuphophyllus table 

 wood chemistry and linkages to community structure 

pca ordination of wood chemistry from samples utilized for pyrotag sequencing showed 

a decay class separation corresponding to total n and p this separation was more distinct in 

haliburton samples as the chapleau early and mid decay stages ordinated together figure 

 when a broader set of samples was investigated chapleau communities did not separate by 

decay class figure wood chemistry particularly total n and p changed clearly with decay 

stage at haliburton figure rda explorations of t rflp community structure and 

chemical variables identified phosphorus as the chemical driving differences in chapleau inner 

wood and haliburton communities figure figure sulphur was the chemical found to 

drive differences between chapleau outer wood communities figure 

 discussion 

 microbial community change through the decay process 

decaying wood is a dynamic system throughout the decay process the biological 

physical and chemical characteristics of the wood are irreversibly transformed harmon et al 

 heilmann clausen christensen maser et al the t rflp based outer 

wood communities in chapleau and both the inner and outer wood communities in haliburton 

clearly changed along this spectrum figure figure many nutrients physical 

characteristics and biological parameters are involved in the relationship between microbial taxa 

and cwd decay status phosphorus is a limiting nutrient in the haliburton forest and also 

potentially in boreal soils so it is not surprising that this had a relationship to community change 

in this study figure figure gradowski thomas maynard paré 

also microbial communities have been shown to respond to phosphorus gradients in soil and 

thus it may follow that they were responding to them in wood as well cruz et al 

deforest scott phosphorus has been shown to increase through decay laiho 

prescott rudz and contrary to phosphorus affecting the microbial communities it 

could be that the organisms in the wood were altering the phosphorus content through active 

import interestingly sulphur was the most related to decay differences of the measured 



 

 

elements nutrients in the chapleau wood outer surface microbial community structure figure 

 sulphur is a key nutrient in certain essential amino acids and many secondary compounds 

and is in especially low concentrations in wood fungi have adapted to utilize to the sulphur 

bound in wood tissues or import it from elsewhere schmalenberger et al the forms of 

sulphur made available after fungal degradation of tissues could lead to further changes in 

microbial community structure there may be more chemical stability within the chapleau 

wood as the chemical composition in these samples did not follow as linear a pattern associated 

with increasing decay as with haliburton wood figure figure 

the nitrogen and phosphorus chemistry of cwd in the context of the pyrotag 

sequencing derived community structure appeared important particularly as nitrogen and 

phosphorus proportionally increase in cwd through decay figure hafner et al 

krankina et al laiho prescott rudz it may be that bacterial 

communities were more strongly linked to these chemical changes because of their dependence 

on their immediate environment for nutrients fungi may be less responsive because they can 

access these elements from soils and thus their own complexity structure is linked to carbon 

source complexity wood physical characteristics and presence of rhizomorphs figure 

 kubicek stokland et al b it was odd that fungi were not more responsive across 

decay spectra as fungal succession has been documented in past studies jönsson et al 

kubartová et al rajala et al there might be less late decay specific fungi 

because of the strategy of fungal growth fungi are often considered as greedy organisms the 

life strategy of fungi involves initial seizure of resources and then monopolization of the use of 

that resource fungi have various adaptations that encourage this hyphal growth allows for quick 

degradation of useful resources and the retained hyphal structures store these resources and 

prevent other organisms from accessing them boddy de boer van der wal 

mueller foster fungi are also notorious producers of anti biotic compounds which 

they use to enhance their ability to dominate a resource until its utility has been extracted 

 mueller foster susi et al once fungi exhaust these resources they will then 

move onto a new more nutrient rich environment and organisms adapted to use the more 

difficult to degrade compounds that remain can become more prevalent though this relationship 

was not as readily apparent with ordination approaches indicator species associated with 

particular decay states of wood demonstrated an apparent association of fungal otus with early 



 

 

and mid decay and many bacterial otus with late decay stages figure figure figure 

 figure 

 site specificity of microbial communities 

there were clear differences between microbial communities across the forests studied 

a pattern that was expected at least for early decay residues not only did the sites have different 

climate conditions that could impact the moisture status of wood but soil characteristics and 

species of decaying wood was different across sites as well figure the combination of 

environment decay status and original residue types relate to cwd types that differ in chemistry 

and carbon content the similarities between chapleau and mississauga especially as revealed 

by pyrotag sequencing analysis could potentially be because of the similar precipitation rates 

between these two sites or because both were old growth forests figure but whatever the 

reason it is intriguing that the sugar maple residues of the same decay state generally had 

disparate microbial communities between haliburton and mississauga harvesting history has 

been shown to effect future cwd decomposition rates and decomposer communities so the lack 

of harvesting in chapleau and mississauga is a plausible explanation for the similarities in 

communities across these sites kebli et al shorohova et al perhaps this was the 

case where similar species that are resistant to the stresses introduced by harvesting have thrived 

in both environments if not caused by land use management similar communities might also be 

a response to the similar precipitation regimes on these sites both were modestly drier than 

haliburton the dependency on environmental moisture is especially true of bacteria in which 

the similarity between chapleau and mississauga communities was apparent in pyrotag 

sequencing data the lack of clear fungal response to these differing conditions could be because 

of the reduced dependence of fungi on environmental moisture through the water scavenging 

adaptations of many fungal species boddy watkinson marjanovic nehls 

mueller foster bacteria are dependent on their immediate environment whereas fungi 

can often import water over distances to support growth in a water scarce nutrient rich substrate 

 boddy watkinson van hees et al 



 

 

 spatial considerations of microbial community structure within 
logs 

the discussion of wood decomposer communities is usually in the context of whole log 

processes brunner kimmins kebli et al rajala et al interestingly 

however it appears that cwd microbial communities and decay processes were different in 

different parts of the log but patterns were not consistent across forest types or tree species this 

was illustrated by the difference between inner and outer communities within haliburton sugar 

maple cwd but not chapleau jack pine cwd figure figure there are numerous 

potential reasons for why these differences were seen the residues were dissimilar being from 

different species of wood which most likely have different decay dynamics due to chemical and 

physical differences different tree species have been shown to have different decay rates and 

community composition under controlled conditions freschet et al prewitt et al 

the lack of change as decay progressed in inner chapleau cwd tissue may have been due to the 

difficulty of colonization of the inner areas due to the structure of the woody material freschet 

et al perhaps acer heartwood was more easily penetrable to fungi than pinus and thus 

allowed for the different community compositions seen through the decay classes in both inner 

and outer haliburton cwd harmon et al schwarze 

 the environment surrounding cwd residues could also influence the decay process the 

surface of late decay cwd in chapleau was consistently colonized by mosses whereas moss 

cover on haliburton residues was inconsistent this could have helped introduce mycorrhizal 

hyphae possibly advancing the decay of cwd outer surfaces botting delong 

kauserud et al outer surfaces are also exposed to multiple avenues of inoculation 

deposition of spores from air and precipitation contact with soils transmission through insects 

and animal contact though the surfaces of chapleau cwd later came to be dominated by 

bryophytes perhaps the past exposure of outer surfaces provided a sufficient reservoir of 

biodiversity to that successive community dynamics were possible throughout the decay process 

exposure changes wood characteristics on the outer surfaces of wood through physical as well as 

biological processes the loss of bark which is significantly different in structure to interior 

wood would be one of these alterations harmon et al maser et al another 

physical process would be leaching as interior wood could have more stability than exterior 

surfaces particularly in early decay stages where water penetration into wood is limited without 



 

 

prolonged exposure to extremely wet conditions edwards jarvis freschet et al 

prewitt et al susi et al the moisture present in these external surfaces during 

wetting events could increase the competitiveness of bacterial species and increase their 

diversity and activity on these surfaces greaves harmon et al 

 influence of site characteristics on decay stage indicator species 

the characteristics of the wood species likely contributed to the different responses of 

indicator species within chapleau and haliburton wood residues the prevalence of cuphophylis 

during early decay of haliburton residues may indicate it was acting as a saprotroph though the 

genus is thought to be associated with mosses moss growth is more common in later stages of 

decay and this genus was reduced in later decay stages nor was it as present in heavily moss 

covered chapleau samples figure figure table botting delong harmon 

et al maser et al the increased variety of early decay stage indicator species in 

haliburton could have occured because of the different primary agents of mortality in each 

ecosystem haliburton historically was high graded leaving poor quality seed stock that resulted 

in a forest of trees susceptible to disease so there might be more plentiful hyphal inoculation 

possibilities for facultative necrotrophs as well as more cwd sourced from necrotrophic fungi 

the most abundant early decay organism was part of the leotiomycetes a family of fungi that 

contains many plant disease causing species figure sanoamuang et al wang et al 

 the main agent of mortality in chapleau is wind and fire and few trees with indications 

of fungal infection were seen it makes sense that sistotrema was in higher abundance in 

chapleau wood as sistotrema are saprobic on wood it is able to monopolize the as yet 

uncolonized cwd from physically introduced mortality events adair et al hibbett 

donoghue other prevalent fungal otus seen in the haliburton cwd could be parasitic 

fungi that have not been fully characterized this may indicate that the mechanism of mortality 

could be a large influence on the degradation of these residues in later years which has been 

found in a previous studies kebli et al stokland et al a if this was the cause of 

the smaller amount of influential fungi in chapleau residues providing mostly wood of slash 

origin to a forest may reduce fungal diversity in future cwd communities if these areas were to 

be reclaimed as natural forest areas the natural mortality of trees could also be affected through 

a reduction in necrotrophic fungi the acidobacteriaceae were likely only important in chapleau 

pine cwd because of its acidic characteristics or perhaps because of the unique phenols in the 



 

 

tissues perhaps the nature of chapleau cwd has restricted the types of bacteria that can flourish 

in these materials which has allowed the acidobacteriaceae to diversify and adapt to the 

different environments through the decay process those acidobacteriaceae species present in 

early decay could be fulfilling some of the same functions as burkholderia in haliburton cwd 

it is difficult to determine their function as the acidobacteriaceae are particularly 

underrepresented in pure culture despite being detected in many acidic environments parte et 

al burkholderia could be using the free sugars in freshly necrotic tissue and those 

released by fungal enzymes the plentiful sugars could induce nitrogen fixation activity that is 

present in members of burkholderia should conditions allow brenner et al it is also 

possible that burkholderia may have been present as an endophytic bacteria during the live 

activity of the wood and be present in larger numbers because of its previous association with 

the live plant burkholderia is a known endophyte of willow and aspen and has been cultivated 

from cutting of trees pirttilä frank endophytes cultured from species of crop plants 

have exhibited antifungal associations with plants and the presence of bacteria introduces an 

element of resource competition that can inhibit fungal growth paul et al pirttilä 

frank the particular burkholderia species may have been an endophyte particularly 

adapted to taking advantage of early fungal degradation of wood tissues in both systems it is 

likely that the different suites of organisms were contributing similar functions through the decay 

process though those activities are conjecture as the characterization of microbial species are far 

from complete 

 consistency in the decay process between distinct forest types 

despite unique decomposer community components in early decay between site 

similarities were present and became more prevalent in later decay stages the elevation of 

bacterial otus shared between sites that occurred in late decay may have been due to initially 

distinct unique structures becoming more structurally similar as residues become highly decayed 

 figure figure the decreased relative abundance of many late decay bacterial indicator 

species could be because of competition for remaining resources a broader suite of remaining 

organic substituents or introduction of greater surface areas and diversities of microenvironments 

within the late decay log chen et al harmon et al krankina et al maser et 

al it is likely that a complex combination of these physical and biological characteristics 

allowed a later decay stage cwd to host such high microbial diversity the increased presence 



 

 

of methylocystis in late decay wood could be an indication that late stage wood experiences 

periods of water excess as this genus requires methane or methanol as a carbon source and 

biogenic methane is most commonly produced in anoxic environments benstead king 

dedysh et al le mer roger early decay stages could possess insufficient 

porosity to enable the water saturation required for methane production or the organisms 

responsible could require nutrients in forms present only in later decay stages fungi seem to be 

more important in early decay which corresponds with the common life strategy of many fungi 

grab the “good” resources and then use them to reproduce boddy competition could be 

controlling the abundance of those species without the ability to effectively penetrate into wood 

tissues and break down the easily available simple sugars still present in early decay wood 

 boddy harmon et al jönsson et al maser et al bacteria may just 

be more competitive when it comes to breaking down the more recalcitrant compounds 

remaining in late decay residues in summation decay seems to be guided first by important 

degradative activities of site specific fungal species and then move towards a bacterial 

dominated process with less site specificity 

 interaction of wood and soils through decay stages 

the differences between soil communities in chapleau and haliburton were generally 

expected as the different soil types vegetation and climate conditions all have the potential to 

influence microbial communities evans wallenstein lukow et al siira 

pietikäinen et al steinweg et al tiessen et al it was strange that the 

diverse characteristics of cwd at different decay stages were not influencing the soil 

communities in direct contact with them it may have been the case that t rflp did not have the 

resolution necessary to detect small phylogenetic differences that may have been occurring as t 

rflp fragments can represent multiple species because closely related species can produce 

similarly sized fragments whereas high throughput techniques such as and illumina 

sequencing can discriminate unique sequences more effectively hafner groffman 

rudz spears holub also because soil cores were taken from the side and 

angled so as to not disturb cwd that was also being sampled too thoroughly they could have 

been influenced more heavily by litter deposition i e a sample more directly under the log may 

have been more influenced by the cwd decay processes this finding of dissimilar communities 

still showed that close contact of soils and cwd did not heavily influence microbial community 



 

 

composition the lack of notable effects on the surrounding soils may have been because of 

localization of fungal explorative structures such as rhizomorphs or hyphal aggregates in the 

sampling area fransson et al lehto zwiazek tedersoo kõljalg it 

could also be because the magnitude of cwd leachates was not sufficient or consistent enough 

to have a transformative effect on the microbial communities in adjacent and underside soils 

cwd in clearcut conditions may have a greater effect because of the loss of regular litter inputs 

from soils and become a more important resource for nutrient provision to soils in the short term 

 hafner et al though this is not necessarily the case as was seen the study outlined in 

chapter and others kataja aho et al siira pietikäinen et al 

 conclusion 

microbial diversity and community structure in decaying wood is influenced by 

time decay stage location within the log environment and residue type there are distinct 

community compositions in different environments residue types and decay states the 

organisms involved are likely important contributors to the nutrient cycling involved with cwd 

in forest environments there is truly such variation in microbial communities within cwd that 

the estimation of biodiversity losses is a daunting task there may have been some resilience in 

community structure through those species that are retained throughout the decay process and 

those that appear to be present in diverse environments but specific fungal organisms seemed to 

be important to the initiation of decay the bacterial species that become important in later decay 

stages may source from nearby litter and could be less affected by intensified wood removal 

processes over time early decay organisms may not be dispersed as effectively in a management 

system with less wood debris supply to the forest floor soils may not provide the refuge of 

biodiversity that is necessary to maintain important organisms as those assessed in this study did 

not seem to have any response to the decay status of the wood they were in contact with this 

emphasizes the necessity of retaining these features in forests lest we disturb decay cycles 

potentially altering nutrient dynamics and decay rates of cwd

general conclusion 

 though there have been reports of microbial community and chemical differences 

between intensified harvesting systems compared to typical stem only harvesting only the most 

extreme form of intensification blading was different from stem only harvests in the study 

performed in chapter hartmann et al thiffault et al there are of course 

studies that have reported a general harvesting effect but without differences attributed to 

additional biomass removal treatment kataja aho et al mariani et al tan et al 

 currently the effects of intensified harvesting are not consistent enough to make broad 

generalizations about the implementation of this type of intensified management though 

microbial communities between harvesting treatments were not apparent the consistent 

difference between control and harvested sites demonstrated that harvesting disturbance changed 

the microbial community structure and function in harvested stands however the differences 

between harvested and fire sites showed that this change was not replicating the microbial 

community structure of the natural mortality event of fire these were potentially important 

differences as the chapleau system is fire adapted and local vegetation and microbial 

communities likely require fire in order to undergo normal successional processes harmon et 

al stenlid et al these differences could extend to survival or loss of important 

microorganisms that could modulate plant competition van der heijden et al this 

could have been true in the sites sampled in this study particularly since some of the otus 

exhibiting differences between harvested and fire sites were identified as a bradyrhizobiaceae 

and hyphomicrobiaceae families of bacteria well known for having members with mutualistic 

plant symbiont characteristics denison kiers it could be possible that differences 

could emerge after future years of wood degradation and altered nutrient input levels into the 

soils of the harvested plots as the degradation of materials was minimal in the two years of 

sampling unfortunately it could be years before changes similar to the study by hartmann et al 

 emerge in chapleau soils 

microbial communities present during wood decay would not be informative when 

attempting to predict soil community changes from biomass removal and large even age wood 

inputs from harvesting practices microbial communities within wood of various decay states 

did not appear to have an observable relationship with the microbial communities in closely 



 

 

associated soils it may be that soils were not immediately impacted by wood removal and only 

respond to long term nutrient inputs hartmann et al thiffault et al the above 

ground communities associated with cwd would be greatly impacted by harvesting 

intensification through alteration of the cwd distributions across the forest landscape decay 

was shown to be unique to an environment regardless of residue type it could be difficult to 

restore microbial communities in decaying cwd pools should there be sufficient disturbance 

harvesting events can damage existing cwd through mechanical alterations of the landscape 

and the remaining and reduced in intensified systems slash materials are all fresh un colonized 

wood higgins lindgren morris et al the decomposition communities 

associated with cwd on such a landscape could be altered compared to those exposed to natural 

disturbance events kebli et al shorohova et al stenlid et al the loss of 

early successional decay species could be especially detrimental decay of wood could be 

drastically altered by the lack of initial structural decomposition perpetrated by these species in 

a landscape without trees and with reduced slash materials necrotrophs requiring live trees could 

be particularly affected 

it appeared that the moisture regime of an environment had an effect on microbial 

community structure as well the similarities between mississauga and chapleau wood may have 

been related to this moisture related impacts could be lessened in forest management systems 

such as selection and shelterwood cuts where site exposure post harvest may be less extreme 

than in clearcut systems the increased exposure of cwd materials could effect colonization by 

early decay organisms through introducing drying rewetting stresses that may not exist in the 

buffered forest environment evans wallenstein these factors could influence future 

decomposition communities in wood residues of harvested sites possibly extending the time of 

decay if important early decay organisms are not present to begin structural decomposition 

processes reduced decomposition of wood residues would impact potentially important nutrient 

cycling processes and thus long term soil characteristics kruys et al rudz spears 

 lajtha spears holub 

the reduction of slash materials could also have positive effects from a management 

perspective despite the potential negative ecological impacts possibly nectrotrophic organisms 

were some of the main fungal agents of early decay in haliburton forest a reduction of slash 

materials could reduce the propagation of some of these organisms and lower the potential for 



 

 

infection in healthy trees stenlid et al however extensive reduction of these organisms 

could reduce available habitat by reducing the future availability of standing dead trees harmon 

et al maser et al in contrast to the haliburton environment fungal diversity in 

chapleau appeared to be more related to saprobic growth the diversity of the saprobes 

responsible for this decay may be dependent on large scale wood inputs as the main natural 

disturbance events in boreal environments are wind and fire stenlid et al 

the study in chapter showed that there are inconsistencies between the decay of wood 

in different environments that could make policy regarding these ecological features especially 

challenging the lack of microbial community consistency in the spatial context of chapleau 

logs was not found in haliburton logs further investigation is needed to see how this may affect 

decomposition in these materials the difference in the process of decomposition emphasizes the 

need to consider many site specific characteristics when discussing wood decomposition 

particularly sources of wood inputs and site history kebli et al stokland et al a 

into the future the island lake site in chapleau will be a valuable resource to study the 

effect of intensified biomass harvesting on interactions between cwd and soil microbial 

communities in a boreal context in future years as vegetation becomes more established and 

microbial communities might develop more discrete differences in response to the intensification 

gradient the interactions of boreal vegetation and microbial communities could reveal important 

relationships modulating biogeochemical cycles also in future years as wood decays the effect 

of intensification on microbial succession through the decay spectrum should be assayed 

whether important decay organisms are impacted by the change in residue prevalence remains to 

be seen but if these alterations were to occur there could be ecological impacts affecting insects 

plants and small animals harmon et al future microbial communities should be 

monitored to see if differences do emerge as seen by hartmann et al and what 

microbially modulated activities have significant contributions to the overall ecosystem 

functioning of the boreal forest

dca with the vegan package provided by r statistical software otu peaks were analyzed for 

presence absence in samples as those species that could be detected by t rflp were assumed to 

be a large component of the total microbial community oksanen et al r core team 

 an adonis test using an eigenvalue method was performed to determine whether there 

were significant differences between groupings oksanen et al the variance explained 

by each factor was used to determine which subsets of data should be further investigated
