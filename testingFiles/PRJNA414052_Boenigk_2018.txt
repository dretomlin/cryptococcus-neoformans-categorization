abstract
protists influence ecosystems by modulating microbial population size diversity metabolic outputs and gene flow in this study 
we used eukaryotic ribosomal amplicon diversity from european freshwater lakes sampled in august to assess the effect 
of mountain ranges as biogeographic barriers on spatial patterns and microbial community structure in european freshwaters the 
diversity of microbial communities as reflected by amplicon clusters suggested that the eukaryotic microbial inventory of lakes was 
well sampled at the european and at the local scale our pan european diversity analysis indicated that biodiversity and richness of 
high mountain lakes differed from that of lowland lakes further the taxon inventory of high mountain lakes strongly contributed to 
beta diversity despite a low taxon inventory even though ecological factors in general strongly affect protist community pattern 
we show that geographic distance and geographic barriers significantly contribute to community composition particularly for high 
mountain regions which presumably act as biogeographic islands however community composition in lowland lakes was also 
affected by geographic distance but less pronounced as in high mountain regions in consequence protist populations are locally 
structured into distinct biogeographic provinces and community analyses revealed biogeographic patterns also for lowland lakes 
whereby european mountain ranges act as dispersal barriers in particular for short to intermediate distances whereas the effect of 
mountain ranges levels off on larger scale 

protists algae are the dominant primary producers in 
aquatic ecosystems and contribute roughly to glob 
al primary production i e they are of similar importance 
as land plants heterotrophic protists on the other hand 
are the primary agents of the top down control of bacte 
ria and primary producers and are thus key organisms in 
determining the fate and transport of organic matter in 
nature boenigk and arndt caron foissner

increasing our knowledge of biodiversity distribution 
patterns at any level of the tree of life is of paramount

introduction
protists are not only a very diverse group of organisms 
but also quantitatively and qualitatively important com 
ponents of all ecosystems their key ecological role has 
become a paradigm in microbial ecology based on the 
concept of the microbial loop azam et al boenigk 
and arndt pomeroy prokaryotes essential 
ly drive freshwater biogeochemical processes whereas 
macroorganisms structure aquatic food webs and pro 
tists drive aquatic primary production and link algal and 
bacterial production to higher trophic levels autotrophic

 this is of particular importance as distribution and 
diversity patterns are generally linked to ecosystem func 
tioning and stability cardinale et al in the past 
protist distributrion has largely been investigated with a 
focus on ecological factors besides climate the ph and 
the concentration of ions and nutrients are particularly 
important structuring factors on the local scale azovsky 
et al triadó margarit and casamayor wu et 
al a large scale plankton analysis demonstrated 
temperature to be a major driver of community compo 
sition in the marine de vargas et al whereas nu 
trient concentrations and ph seem to be more important 
in freshwater communities tolotti et al tolotti et 
al triadó margarit and casamayor further 
and particular along alpine gradients elevation and envi 
ronmental parameters co varying with elevation such as 
uv intensity also affect protist taxa and potentially shape 
communities sommaruga sonntag et al 

in contrast to ecological factors the biogeographic dis 
tribution patterns of protists and the significance of histor 
ical factors potentially structuring their distribution came 
only recently into focus in contrast for macroorganisms 
biogeography and the factors driving distribution patterns 
of life on earth have attracted scientists already for cen 
turies the realization that different geographic regions 
despite similar ecological conditions may be inhabited 
by different organisms goes back at least to buffon 
 browne and became prominent as the first 
principle of biogeography the importance of geographic 
barriers has been accepted since humboldt’s work on plant 
biogeography in humboldt and bonpland 

while biogeographic theory has developed into a 
strong conceptual framework for understanding the dis 
tribution patterns of animals and plants its applicability 
to microbes has remained controversial there have been 
disputes on the biogeographic distribution of microbial 
organisms since at least the early th century sprengel 
and de candolle during the past few centuries a 
uniform global dispersal has been proposed for microor 
ganisms culminating in the claim of baas becking and 
beijerink that “everything is everywhere but the hab 
itat selects” bass and boenigk wit and bouvier 
 only recently has increasing evidence demon 
strated that protists have a biogeography and the under 
lying assumption of a worldwide dispersal of protists has 
been progressively replaced by the acceptance of the en 
demic distribution of at least some taxa bass and boe 
nigk foissner livermore and jones 
the research focus has consequently recently turned to 
the underlying patterns of protist distribution while dis 
persal limitation is now generally accepted bik et al 
 grossmann et al a katz et al fernán 
dez et al 

most if not all microbial ecologists meanwhile agree 
that at least some single celled organisms have limited 
distribution patterns filker et al kammerlander 
et al van der gast wu et al and that 

on a larger scale historical and geographic factors may 
also affect protist distribution and dispersal filker et al 
 izaguirre et al however despite indica 
tions of large scale variation between protist communi 
ties geographical factors are considered to be of minor 
importance at short to intermediate distances beisner 
et al filker et al if this turns out to be 
true protist distribution patterns would clearly deviate 
from those of macroorgansims in particular in europe 
due to the recent geological past of this continent in the 
quarternary europe underwent several cycles of glacia 
tions which strongly structured biological communities 
– at least of macroorganisms hewitt specifically 
stated that “the present genetic structure of populations 
species and communities has been mainly formed by 
quaternary ice ages” in europe these patterns com 
prise centers of endemism specifically in high moun 
tain areas albach et al schmitt as well 
as genetically distinct lineages mainly in the lowlands 
derived from different refugia santucci et al he 
witt babik et al europe is the probably 
best investigated area for biogeographic patterns hew 
itt schmitt and therefore an ideal test case 
for further testing the importance of historic factors in 
structuring the biogeography of protists the european 
orogenes – the alps in the center of europe and further 
orogenes towards the west pyrenees massif central to 
the south apennine to the east high tatra carpathi 
an mountains and to the north scandinavian orogenes 
constitute a unique area for glacial distribution barriers 
since the maximum of the last glaciation some 
years ago litt et al habbe cold adapted 
species took refuge in high mountain areas resulting in 
considerable endemism hewitt schmitt 
whereas warm adapted species retracted to southern 
europe and re colonised central europe along several 
routes around the orogenes yielding genetically differ 
entiated populations in the lowlands 

here we focus on the importance of the recent geo 
logical history to the distribution patterns of protists in 
lakes for protists geographic gradients are generally 
known e g casteleyn et al but presumably weaker 
in freshwaters than in marine systems hillebrand 
or in soils grossmann et al a nevertheless even 
though geographic gradients are assumed to be weak in 
protists gimmler et al historical factors presuma 
bly affect protist distribution as their distribution patterns 
in freshwater violate the assumption of unlimited dispersal 
 grossmann et al a in particular we hypothesize 
that european mountain ranges act as dispersal barriers 
for protists it is unknown to what extent diversity patterns 
as known for macroorganisms also apply to the less fa 
miliar and less readily observable protists inhabiting these 
same ecosystems mahé et al to evaluate diversity 
patterns at the microbial scale for protists we conducted 
a dna metabarcoding study based on a large scale com 
parison including lakes across europe

tat isolation due to either ecological factors i e habitat 
heterogeneity or geographic factors i e isolation due to 
geographic barriers the high beta diversity data and the 
high values within the distance matrix indicated that dif

beta diversity was due to replacement and of beta 
diversity was due to abundance differences when the

beyond the general effect of geographic distance geo 
graphic barriers such as mountain ranges contributed sig 
nificantly to community dissimilarity between lowland 
sites on a european scale mean community similarity 
was higher for lakes within a given lowland area as com 
pared to community similarities of lakes between areas 
which were separated by a mountain range fig b for 
instance separate analyses of sites north of the alps and 
south of the alps resulted in comparatively high commu 
nity similarities over a short distance and a pronounced 
decrease of community similarity with geographic dis 
tance in contrast community similarity was generally 
low for habitat pairs across a mountain range already for 
short distances and geographic distance had a minor effect 
on community similarity in the latter case thus biogeog 
raphy in particular geographic distance and geographic 
barriers shapes protist distribution pattern interestingly 
distant lakes still share a fraction of their taxon inven 
tory clearly demonstrating that geographic distance and 
geographic structures such as mountains are not absolute 
barriers to protist dispersal the effects of geographic dis 
tance and geographic barriers are however not strictly 
additive in contrast both factors add to community dis 
similarity up to a certain level of background community 
similarity shaped by environmental variables 

protist diversity in european lakes is structured into bio 
geographic regions

despite a generally low community similarity between 
different lakes groups of lakes sharing a higher level of 
community similarity can be identified lakes sharing 
a higher degree of community similarity form clusters 
reflecting biogeographic provinces on a european scale 
 fig b notably mountain ranges are borders to protist 
biogeographic provinces as for animals and plants as well 
this pattern was consistent in particular for the alps the 
pyrenees and the high tatras the taxon inventory of high 
mountain regions strongly deviates from that of lowland 
regions and lowland areas are separated from each oth 
er based on their taxon inventory into distinct provinces 
these provinces do not correspond to physicochemical 
patterns or to the distribution of soil types or geology in 
europe suggesting that factors related to geographic dis 
tance and dispersal are key reasons for this separation it 
must be noted that towards the edges of the investigation 
area the delimitation of such biogeographic regions be 
come more uncertain due to the shortage of neighboring 
sampling sites or sites in between for instance whether 
the lakes indicated by the blue squares in eastern spain 
and northern italy represent a connected biogeographic 
province or rather two separate areas which share a high 
similarity by chance remains uncertain 

the decreasing effect of mountain ranges in separating 
protist communities with distance between sites indicates 
that geographic barriers act only as relative dispersal bar 
riers for protists they do not inhibit dispersal but rather 
slow it down and thereby largely act on short to interme 

diate distances for larger distances the separating effect 
of geographic barriers adding to that of geographic dis 
tance alone largely vanishes as demonstrated by cis cis 
and trans trans i e within a distinct lowland area ver 
sus cis trans i e lowland sites separated by a mountain 
range comparisons of habitat dissimilarities fig b

into focus green et al lara et al livermore 
and jones nolte et al even though ecolog 
ical factors are largely responsible for structuring protist

further obscured by partly inappropriate species delimi 
tation in protists mann and vanormelingen sco 
ble and cavalier smith appropriate species de 
limitation and thus species distributions are even more 
nebulous for the vast number of so far uncultivatable 
protist lineages massana et al assertions on the 
absolute species numbers and species inventory are there 
fore imprecise and subject to numerous assumptions it is 
therefore important to keep in mind that some taxonomic 
groups are underrepresented and may exhibit patterns de 
viating from the general trend keeping this in mind the 
community composition corresponded to those known 
from other studies e g lange et al kammerlander 
et al filker et al 

our analysis based on european lakes yielded 
in distinct unique v sequence swarms rar 
efaction analysis as well as preston vein indicated that 
we captured most of the diversity however molecular 
diversity inventories based on high throughput sequenc 
ing techniques must be interpreted with caution as high 
throughput sequencing platforms are error prone and 
in particular for sequences exclusively present in one 
or very few samples pcr artefacts and sequencing er 
rors must be taken into account degnan and ochman 
 lange et al the ampiconduo filter large 
ly removed such sequences by splitting the samples fol 
lowed by two independent pcrs and sequencing steps for 
each sample only errors that occurred independently in 
both branches of the split sampling protocol may pass the 
filter even though it is highly unlikely that high numbers 
of artificial sequences pass the filter it is known that some 
artefacts such as formation of some chimeric sequences 
may in part occur systematically fonseca et al 
and thus escape the filter in fact particularly some chi 
meric sequences pass the ampliconduo filter and not all 
of these sequences are recognized by chimera filters such 
as uchime lange et al therefore it is likely 
that some artificial sequences passed the filter steps even 
though the share of sequence artefacts is probably lower 
as compared to past standard filtering algorithms how 
ever erroneous sequences should mostly be restricted to 
a single sample and thus not or hardly affect our analyses 
of community pattern across samples the high number 
of otus restricted to a single lake may nevertheless be 

overestimated it is likely however that due to the strict 
filtering steps the majority of these otus represent true 
biological diversity 

for some samples the number of otus was considera 
bly lower as expected this may be due to several factors 
first our filter strategy including the ampliconduo filter 
and swarm reduced the number of otus considerably 
in particular ampliconduo filtered out many presuma 
bly artificial sequences most of which had low to medi 
um read numbers therefore the total number of otus 
should be expected to be somewhat smaller as compared 
to studies which do not apply this or a comparable filter 
 lange et al second the comparatively long am 
plicon v its and the long primer constructs also 
may miss some sequences as it is generally known for 
long primer constructs and long amplicons huber et al 
 third some samples were strongly dominated by 
one or very few taxa due to algal blooms or strong domi 
nance of a distinct bacterivore for instance lake pford 
ter see which was strongly dominated by a katablepha 
rid yielded in as few as otus in such communities 
a lower taxon coverage was to be expected which may 
even have been self inforcing as the dominance of one 
distinct sequence may cause a negative selection of rare 
sequences during pcr thereby further decreasing detec 
tion limits even though the total number of otus was 
certainly lower than the actual number of species present 
the data structure as well as observations indicate that bi 
ological reasons i e community structure is presumably 
largely responsible for low otu numbers in these lakes 
in sum even though in some lakes otu number was 
surprisingly low data structure and observations during 
sampling indicate that a strong dominance by few otus 
in these lakes is presumably largely real additional taxa 
even though presumably extremely rare are certainly to 
be expected however for the comparative analyses the 
applied hellinger transformation balanced potentially de 
viating distributions and the analysis of distribution pat 
terns is much less affected when based on defined units 
of biological diversity such as the herein used v otus 

contribution of biogeography and historical factors to

jens boenigk et al geographic distance and mountain ranges structure 

west pyrenees massif central the south apennine 
the east high tatras carpathian mountains and to the 
north scandinavian mountain ranges – constitute a 
unique area for studying the effect of distribution barriers 

based on the largest freshwater data set known to us 
we demonstrate a significant contribution of geographical 
distance and historical factors to protist distribution pat 
terns we found spatial patterns of protist diversity with 
microbial community composition varying both with alti 
tude in mountain ranges and with geographical distance 
seasonal taxon fluctuations influence protist communi 
ty composition and may interfere with spatial analyses 
when samples originate from different seasons bock et 
al massana et al nolte et al consid 
ering that all samples in our campaign were taken in au 
gust and that seasonal effects and plankton succes 
sion dynamics is presumably lower in mid summer lake 
plankton communities than in spring succession com 
munities naselli flores et al the observed diver 
gence presumably reflects largely spatial differentiation of 
lake plankton communities rather than seasonal variation 
 grossmann et al b however due to the large area 
included in the analysis a certain bias due to differential 
stages of the seasonal succession cannot be excluded 

recently de vargas et al have shown that the 
correlation between community similarity and geograph 
ic distance in marine ecosystems levels off for distances 
greater than km our data confirm a similar rela 
tionship for limnic lowland systems which act however 
at shorter distances and is modified by local and regional 
geography in particular bray curtis dissimilarity sup 
plementary material increased with distance but this 
correlation already levelled off for large distances and 
virtually vanished for sampling sites separated by geo 
graphic barriers this indicates that protist freshwater 
communities in europe are presumably largely driven not 
by geographic but by ecological factors 

for instance we found a general trend of decreas 
ing richness for high elevation lakes i e high mountain 
lakes at elevations above approximately m showed 
a lower mean richness as compared to lakes at low el 
evations this may be due to either the generally small 
size of mountain lakes as would be expected from spe 
cies area relationships or indicate differential patterns of 
richness depending on elevation as small lakes at low 
elevation can show a high richness we suspect that both 
habitat size and elevation or factors co varying with ele 
vation may be repsonsible for the low richness 

even though ecological factors are certainly of prima 
ry importance explaining for protist community composi 
tion the contribution of geographic distance and historical 
factors or geographic barriers seems to have a stronger 
impact on protist freshwater communities than on marine 
communities cf de vargas et al further for high 
mountain ranges the effect of geographic distance is more 
pronounced as these regions are more isolated and may 
act as biogeographic islands at least to species with re 
stricted dispersal capabilities in this context it must be 

noted that a considerable portion of protist distribution 
pattern is not explained by geograhic separation indicat 
ing that it is either restricted by other factors i e presum 
ably ecology or not restricted by the geographic barriers 
i e suggesting that the significance of geographic barriers 
may strongly differ between taxa however our data pro 
vide evidence that historical factors contribute to shaping 
protist distribution pattern fernández et al beyond 
the presumably predominant effects of ecological factors 

according to the generally high beta diversity our 
study revealed a high proportion of taxa exclusively 
found in only one or a few lakes the very low contribtion 
of nestedness of the high elevation lakes and the some 
what higher contribution of nestedness to beta diversity 
in the northern lowland lakes may be interpreted as his 
torical signals of the last glaciation and the post glacial 
colonisation however as these differences are weak the 
interpretation as a historical signal remains hypothetical 
how far postglacial resettlement geographical barri 
ers other historical reasons ecological parameters like 
nutrient supply or just biotic influences by other organ 
ismic groups dominate the exceptionality of the protist 
communities within lakes remains to be shown further 
it is likely that ecological and historical factors interact 
in shaping protist distribution pattern fernández et al 
 irrespective of protist community differentiation 
due to ecological factors and geographic distance we 
found a weak but nevertheless significant effect of moun 
tain ranges as geographic barriers contributing to the sep 
aration of low elevation lakes fig future large scale 
analyses including cross continental comparisons of such 
large datasets in particular of lakes of a similar trophic 
status will be a good test to confirm large scale patterns 
of geographic differentiation in protists and to differenti 
ate regional from global patterns 

conclusions
mountain ranges have long been accepted as dispersal 
barriers for larger animals and plants but their sig 
nificance as dispersal barriers for microbes remained 
unclear we demonstrate a differential impact of geo 
graphic distance for lowland and for highland lakes 
biodiversity and richness of high mountain lakes dif 
fer from that of lowland lakes in accordance with the 
patterns for animals and plants nogués bravo et al 
 romdal and grytnes the mean protist rich 
ness was lower in high mountain lakes than in lowland 
lakes due to a high variation of the taxon inventory 
of individual lakes this correlation only becomes ap 
parent for high sampling numbers and therefore does 
not contradict more confined studies on smaller sample 
sets grossmann et al b however as a partic 
ularly high fraction of taxa in high mountain lakes is 
presumably specific to only one or just a few lakes the 
high mountain lakes strongly contribute to beta diversi 
ty despite the low taxon inventory

furthermore mountain ranges act as islands of high 
mountain protist biodiversity and geographic distance ac 
cordingly clearly contributed to community dissimilarity 
however it must be noted that the overall contribution of 
geography to protist distribution pattern in lakes was low 
but nevertheless significant other factors such as abiot 
ic and biotic factors presumably contribute to community 
composition much stronger as geography as it has been 
suggested in numerous studies beisner et al filker 
et al and references therein with respect to low 
land lakes mountain ranges act as barriers to the dispersal 
of protist biodiversity as already known for macroorgan 
isms schmitt thus protist community dissimilar 
ity is high even at short distances when geographic barri 
ers separate the habitats in this respect protist distribution 
patterns are similar to those of metazoans and land plants 
however the comparatively low effect of mountain rang 
es indicate that geographic and historical factors even 
though certainly present are less pronounced in protist 
communities as compared to plant and animal commu 
nities mountain ranges can block direct dispersal routes 
of microbes or at least of some microbial taxa but a clear 
separation of biogeographic regions as observed for ani 
mals and plants is much less pronounced and levels off for 
lowland lakes on larger scales nevertheless geographic 
structures affect protist distribution patterns on a europe 
an scale as reflected by distinct biogeographic regions

	geographic distance and mountain ranges structure freshwater protist communities on a european scale
	abstract
	introduction
	material and methods
	site selection and field sampling
	dna extraction pcr and sequencing
	sequence filtering
	statistical analysis

	data resources
	results
	protist freshwater communities show high levels of diversity
	high mountain lakes differ from lowland lakes in taxon inventory and act as biogeographic islands
	geographic distance shapes protist distribution patterns and mountain ranges act as barriers to protist dispersal
	protist diversity in european lakes is structured into biogeographic regions

	discussion
	eukaryotic microbial molecular diversity in european freshwaters
	contribution of biogeography and historical factors to the differentiation of freshwater communities
