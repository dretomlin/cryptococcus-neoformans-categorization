abstract microscopic eukaryotes play a key role in ecosys 
tem functioning but their diversity remains largely unexplored
in most environments to advance our knowledge of eukary 
otic microorganisms and the factors that structure their commu 
nities high throughput sequencing was used to characterize
their diversity and spatial distribution along the pollution gra 
dient of the acid mine drainage at carnoulès france a total of
 reads were retrieved leading to the identification of 
otus after normalization phylogenetic analysis revealed a
quite diverse eukaryotic community characterized by a total
of eight high level lineages including classes the majority
of sequences were clustered in four main groups fungi 
stramenopiles alveolata and viridiplantae the reigous sed 
iments formed a succession of distinct ecosystems hosting
contrasted eukaryotic communities whose structure appeared
to be at least partially correlated with sediment mineralogy 
the concentration of arsenic in the sediment was shown to be

a significant factor driving the eukaryotic community structure
along this continuum

introduction

acid mine drainage amd refers to extreme aquatic environ 
ments resulting from the dissolution of pyrite rich mining
wastes because of their acid ph and their high concentrations
of toxic metals and metalloids they are an environmental and
public health threat in these ecosystems adapted microor 
ganisms are involved in biogeochemical mechanisms that con 
trol the behavior of metals and metalloids at the water sediment
interface indeed the microorganisms that colonize amd are
responsible for the release of metals and metalloids and for the
acidification resulting from oxidation of pyrite rich waste 
microbial metabolism can also mitigate pollution for example 
by co precipitation of arsenic with iron the prokaryotic
communities that colonize amd particularly bacteria have
been extensively studied and generally include organisms in 
volved in the iron sulfur or arsenic cycles – on the other
hand studies of the eukaryotic members of the microbial com 
munities are rare and the involvement of eukaryotes in the
biogeochemical cycles of these extreme environments is poorly
understood – culture independent gene surveys have re 
vealed relatively high eukaryotic richness in the río tinto
river in spain including members of the bacillariophyta 
chlorophyta rhodophyta and euglenophyta phyla as well as
ciliates cercomonads amoebae stramenopiles fungi 
heliozoans and rotifers in contrast studies at

eukaryotic diversity mainly dominated by fungi associated
with the presence of a small proportion of heterolobosea and
protists affiliated with the deeply branching lineage named the
acidophilic protist clade apc 

the ecological role of eukaryotic microorganisms is of
great importance in mining environments some protists
isolated from amd graze on specific acidophilic bacteria
 suggesting they impact the abundance and the
community composition of prokaryotes involved in key
biogeochemical processes such as acid mine generation
or mitigation via oxidation or reduction of iron and sulfur
compounds a strain of the algae cyanidioschyzon sp 
isolated from the yellowstone national park was shown
to be directly implicated in the as cycle oxidizing
as iii reducing as v and methylating as iii to form
trimethylarsine oxide and dimethylarsenate some
photosynthetic organisms like euglena mutabilis or the
filamentous algae klebsormidium not only provide oxy 
gen but can also be directly involved in the development
of stromatolite like and organo sedimentary structures
that are rich in iron and play an important role in remedi 
ation because of their ecological importance and
their potential for bioremediation the full diversity and
the precise role of eukaryotes in amd along with the
environmental parameters that structure their communities
require further investigation 

the level of pollution at carnoulès france is particu 
larly high with arsenic concentrations ranging from to
 mg l− in the reigous creek spring which corre 
sponds to the amd draining the site microbial activ 
ity is involved in the natural attenuation process that oc 
curs at this site and results in a pollution gradient along
reigous creek in particular microbial iron and arsenic
oxidation leads to the removal of dissolved arsenic by
co precipitation with fe iii and formation of as iii 
fe iii and as v fe iii phases associated with sulfate
in the reigous riverbed the concentration of
arsenic subsequently decreases by nearly between
the source of reigous creek and its confluence with the
amous river m downstream bacterial and archaeal
communities have been extensively studied at this site 
 – however to date the eukaryotic community thriv 
ing in this ecosystem remains largely unexplored although
cultivation based studies revealed the presence of fungi
along the creek and the presence of the acidophilic
protozoan euglena mutabilis this photosynthetic
organism may play an indirect but important role in natural
amd attenuation through primary production 
indeed an increase in the concentration of dissolved oxy 
gen in these oligotrophic waters probably increases metal
precipitation rates furthermore euglena mutabilis is
able to sequester and store iron and other metals both in 
tracellularly and extracellularly 

determining eukaryotic diversity is the first step in
assessing the potential influence of eukaryotes on metal and
metalloid cycling and on ecosystem functioning in the
carnoulès as rich amd to this end eukaryotic diversity in
reigous riverbed sediments was investigated using a
barcoded pyrosequencing approach targeting the hypervari 
able v v regions of the eukaryotic small subunit s ribo 
somal rna rrna gene to help understand how
environmental stressors determine the structure of the micro 
bial community the eukaryotic spatial pattern was character 
ized in relation with the physicochemical and mineralogical
conditions observed in situ along the pollution gradient

site description

the pb zn carnoulès mine is located in southern france in the
drainage basin of the river rhône mining activity stopped in
 but left about mt of solid wastes containing pb 
 fe and as stored behind a dam water percolating
through the wastes emerges at the base of the tailing dam and
forms the source of reigous creek this water is acidic ph
around sub oxic dissolved oxygen concentration below
 mg l− and rich in dissolved sulfate iron and arsenic
 – – and – mg l− respectively 
iron and arsenic are mainly present in their reduced forms
fe ii and as iii mean annual rainfall is mm with
a distribution typical of the mediterranean climate character 
ized by long periods of drought and intense rainfall events
mainly in spring and fall 

sampling procedure and physicochemical analysis

a sampling campaign was carried out in november at
five sampling sites along reigous creek samples were col 
lected at the spring s m downstream cowg m
downstream at two sampling sites characterized by different
sediment textures stromatolite like structure with laminated
hard concretions called gal and soft and creamy sediment
called galm and m downstream conf just before
the confluence of the reigous and the amous river fig 
around cm deep pale yellow loosely packed sediments
were collected in triplicate at the bottom of the creek using a
sterile spatula the three samples were pooled and homoge 
nized solid phases were harvested by centrifugation and dried
under vacuum prior to mineralogical and spectroscopic anal 
yses the main physicochemical parameters ph temperature 
redox potential and dissolved oxygen concentration and con 
centrations of so 

 fe and as in the running water covering
the sediments were measured as previously described

hot plates at °c for h successively with h o 
 a ml concentrated hno hf hclo mixture 
a ml concentrated hno hcl mixture samples were
cooled and evaporated to dryness between each step and at

preliminary quality checks sorting and trimming of the
 reads were performed by gatc biotech according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations the sequences were

then analyzed with mothur software version 
preprocessing of unaligned sequences included removing
sequences pb all sequences containing ambiguous
characters and sequences with more than eight homopoly 
mers in addition we removed sequences that did not align
over the same span of nucleotide positions identical se 
quences were grouped and representative sequences were
aligned against the silva eukaryotic reference database
using the needleman–wunsch algorithm chimeric
sequences were detected and removed using the implemen 
tation of chimera uchime a further screening step
 pre cluster was applied to reduce sequencing noise by
clustering reads that differed by only one base every 
bases the remaining high quality reads were used to
generate a distance matrix and clustered into operational
taxonomic units otus defined at cutoff using the
average neighbor algorithm the similarity level has
been shown to be the most suitable to reproduce original
eukaryotic diversity next taxonomic affiliation of the
otus was determined using the naïve bayesian classifier
 confidence threshold trained on the rdp’s taxo 
nomic outline implemented in mothur with the pr data 
base note that otus classified as metazoa and
embryophyta were excluded from further analysis to re

water and sediment characteristics

the main physicochemical characteristics of the water collect 
ed from the different sites are listed in esm table s 
reigous creek was characterized by a low ph around that
remained relatively constant along the creek redox potential
 eh showed an increasing trend with values ranging from
 to mv extremely high concentrations of as
 mg l− i ron mg l− and sul fa te
 mg l− were found at the almost anoxic upstream site
s however natural remediation occurred along the m
of the creek characterized by a clear decreasing gradient of
arsenic to mg l− iron to mg l− and
sulfate to mg l− associated with a substantial
increase in the concentration of dissolved oxygen to
 mg l− the reduced forms fe ii and as iii were dom 
inant at all sites except at the downstream site conf which
was the most oxygenated and had the lowest concentrations of
iron sulfate and arsenic 

unlike the clear pollution gradient evidenced in waters 
metals and metalloid concentrations in the sediments were
unevenly distributed along the reigous table the con 
centration of as was particularly high in samples gal s 
and galm and mg g− respectively and
lower at cowg mg g− and conf mg g− no clear
trend was observed along the reigous for fe and s whose
concentrations remained stable at all the sampling sites pb
concentrations ranged between and mg g− with
the highest concentration measured at cowg the concen 
tration of znwas one order of magnitude higher at conf than
in the other sediments table 

the nature and structure of the sediment samples were
also investigated using mineralogical and spectroscopic
methods xrd analyses esm figure s showed that
the mineralogical composition evolved from mainly
tooeleite fe aso so oh · h o upstream sample

 samples gal and galm and to schwertmannite down 
stream fe o oh so sample conf sample cowg
was sandy with quartz and micas xanes analyses for
cowg gal galm and conf at the arsenic k edge 
showed that despite the presence of an as iii component
accounting for – ± of total arsenic the oxidized
arsenic form as v predominated in these samples esm
 figure s in contrast sample s was characterized by a
larger proportion of as iii reaching ± of total ar 
senic which was expected since this sample essentially
consisted of tooeleite a rare iron arsenite mineral found
in large amounts in the carnoulès sediments exafs
data confirmed that as iii dominated over as v in sam 
ple s with the presence of tooeleite and as iii sorbed
schwertmannite esm figure s downstream in
reigous creek as v was mainly present as amorphous
fe iii –as v hydroxysulfate phase as iii likely being
sorbed to poorly ordered schwertmannite these findings
are in good agreement with previously observed as speci 
ation in reigous creek in winter

spatial variation along the reigous creek

diversity and species richness of the eukaryotic community
varied considerably in the streambed sediments table the
shannon diversity h and chao richness indices ranged

from to and to respectively while the
arsenic rich sediments s galm and gal displayed similar
levels of species richness and diversity cowg located only
 m downstream from reigous spring exhibited the highest
values chao h this is consistent with the
rarefaction curves that tended to reach an asymptote for all
the samples except cowg fig the conf site represent 
ed an intermediate situation chao h good’s
coverage ranged from to with an average value of

were recovered in the majority of samples table 

to investigate the spatial distribution of the eukaryotic com 
munity along the reigous creek we compared eukaryotic com 
munities based on community membership a venn diagram

vealed that a high proportion of otus in each sediment sample

sediments and showed of similarity with escovopsis sp 
esc the samples galm and gal retrieved from distinct

otus corresponding to and of their respective taxa 
more generally the proportion of shared otus between at least
two sites was very low but corresponded to a high pro 
portion of the total sequences fig to analyze these
shifts in community composition along the pollution gradient in
more detail we examined the dynamics of the four dominant

discussion

diversity patterns and methodological considerations

in agreement with a previous study conducted at richmond
mine our results suggest that despite the extreme char 
acteristics of these systems diverse organisms can grow in
amd although they are dominated by a few taxa

most of the sequences retrieved correspond to lineages
previously found in other amds including members of the
chlorophyta streptophyta and bacillariophyta phyla as
well as rhizaria alveolata amoebozoa stramenopiles
and fungi however some taxa detected in the
present study have not been previously identified in any
amd system such as choanoflagellida fungi were the
dominant group in carnoulès sediments and exhibited high
diversity with different classes identified this phyloge 
netic group was previously evidenced in this ecosystem
using culture based approaches that led to the detection of
 yeast species mainly belonging to the phylum
basidiomycota moreover the eukaryotic community
appears to be more diverse than previously described in
other amd ecosystems however substantial
eukaryotic diversity was encountered in the río tinto river
in spain where the eukaryotic community was mainly com 
posed of photosynthetic algae using cloning sequencing
techniques or pyrosequencing 

in the present study euglena mutabilis was not detected 
this photosynthetic acidophilic protist isolated from the
carnoulès ecosystem forming continuous green macroscop 
ic biofilms has been shown to be particularly abundant at the
cowg sampling site we probably only captured a
portion of the entire eukaryotic diversity present in the amd 
because a single pcr primer set does not amplify the s
rrna from all eukaryotes furthermore different
targeted ssu rrna gene sequences might not be pcr 
amplified with equal efficiency by the different primers and
variability within the amplified regions may have a significant
effect on the apparent species richness in addition rich 
ness results should be interpreted with caution given the tech 
nological limits e g differential cell lysis pyrosequencing
errors etc and the unknown variability of the multiple
copies of rrna operons from the same organism 

ecological role of microbial eukaryotes

the eukaryotic populations found in reigous creek can be
grouped according to their potential ecological role as primary
producers decomposers and consumers inferred from the
metabolic capabilities of related microorganisms 

previous studies showed that archaea and bacteria in
carnoulès amd sediment mainly derive energy from sulfur 
iron oxidation or reduction the chemolithoautrotrophic
prokaryotes together with the photosynthetic eukaryotes evi 
denced in this study act as primary producers of biomass in this
ecosystem the photosynthetic eukaryotes detected in
carnoulès mainly belonged to the chlorophyta green algae 
streptophyta and autotrophic classes of the stramenopiles such
as the bacillariophyceae diatoms chrysophyceae golden
algae synurophyceae or euglena photoautrotrophic eukary 
otes may sustain the development of diverse heterotrophicta

 a volant et al 



lineages such asacidiphilium detected in this ecosystem halter
et al showed that the acidophilic protist euglena mutabilis
isolated at the water sediment interface of carnoulès amd
promotes the growth of heterotrophic bacteria by providing
them with organic substrates like amino acids polyamine com 
pounds urea or some sugars moreover as suggested by
gonzalez toril et al the aerobic oxidation of iron sulfur 
or arsenic by prokaryotes acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans 
thiomonas spp thermoplasmatales could be enhanced by
the oxygen produced by photosynthesis thereby highlighting
an indirect role for eukaryotes in the bio attenuation processes
that occur at carnoulès 

our study also revealed the predominance and diversity
of fungi in all the sampling sites fungi are decomposers
and the main producers of organic substances the concen 
tration of easily degradable organic carbon in carnoulès
sediment is probably very low since in acid water the
degradation of organic carbon such as leaves is limited
by the absence of invertebrates thus fungi may
play an important role as primary degraders of complex
organic matter moreover by maintaining low organic
carbon levels and by producing dissolved carbonate ions 
they could promote the growth of chemolithoautotrophic
acidophilic prokaryotes they may also allow the de 
velopment of less metal tolerant species by removing toxic
metals from their environment through several mecha 
nisms such as biosorption sequestration or extracellular
precipitation indeed the most abundant
otu affiliated with rhodotorula mucilaginosa retrieved
from s gal and galm may accumulate zn and pb and

produce siderophores involved in metal resistance and
complexation – members of rhodotorula genus
are also known to enhance ferrous iron oxidation carried
out by acid i th iobaci l lus ferrooxidans fo rmely
thiobacillus ferrooxidans which are active in this ecosys 
tem they also can convert arsenate to arsenite 
dimethylarsinic acid and methylarsonic acid 
furthermore the filamentous fungi eurotiomycetes and
dothideomycetes detected in the present study may im 
prove the anchorage of biofilms to pyrite rich sediment in
amd by increasing their rigidity and organization 

the carnoulès microbial consumer community consists
of heterotrophic protozoa characterized by representatives
of the rhizaria alveolata amebozoa apusozoa and
choanoflagellida protozoa such as oxytrichidae sp pres 
ent in relatively high proportions in s can impact micro 
bial populations and biomass by grazing on heterotrophic
and acidophilic bacteria including iron sulfur oxidizers
and archaea top down control of the bacterial
community by the mixotrophic flagellate ochromonas
sp commonly encountered in amd and in this
study was also evidenced by schmidtke et al 
moreover acidophilic protozoa have been reported to
graze preferentially on acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans over
leptospirillum ferrooxidans resulting in the dominance of
l ferrooxidans in mixed cultures of iron oxidizers and
revealing the impact of protozoa on prokaryotic communi 
ty structure 

our results confirm that diverse eukaryotes colonize ex 
treme environments like amd where they probably play a
substantial role particularly in carbon and metal cycling
through direct or indirect mechanisms making them good
candidates for remediation strategies 

spatial distribution of the eukaryotic community
and influence of environmental drivers

the sediment samples were retrieved from different locations
along the amd reflecting distinct environmental conditions 
the water chemistry varied significantly with a clear decreas 
ing gradient of as fe and sulfates associated with an increas 
ing trend of oxygen content and ph between the spring s 
the most extreme site and the confluence with the amous
river conf the least extreme site the composition of
the sediments also differed according to the mineralogical
analyses including the two samples collected in the same area
 galm and gal however no upstream to downstream
gradient in sediment composition was identified 

these variations in geochemical and mineralogical condi 
tions along reigous creek were associated with important
variations in the structure and composition of the eukaryotic
community only one otu corresponding to sequences
was common to the five sediments and a small proportion

fig principal coordinate analysis pcoa of the eukaryotic community

explanation variables gained by vector fitting the red and blue arrows

corrected p the corresponding r correlation coefficients and p 
values are listed in table 

eukaryotic communities variation in arsenic rich creek sediments 



of otus was shared between at least two sites the marked
differences in the sediment eukaryotic community along
reigous creek show that distinct communities occupy specif 
ic niches however the shared otus correspond to a high
proportion of the total sequences the distribution of the eu 
karyotic community is thus characterized by a low proportion
of dominant otus omnipresent along the creek and a high
proportion of minor taxa specific to each site moreover the
samples galm and gal retrieved from distinct sediments
geographically close in the creek shared only otus 
highlighting the probable selective pressure of local sediment
characteristics on eukaryotic membership patterns 

contrary to what was observed in the río tinto by amaral 
zettler et al eukaryotic richness was not highest at the
most extreme sites of the amd nevertheless diversity was
linked to the composition of the sediment indeed the sedi 
ments sampled at the most diverse site cowg had the low 
est fe and as concentrations while the least diverse site
 gal had the highest concentration of as the eukaryotic
diversity encountered at cowg could be indicative of mature
and well established communities able to sustain relatively
complex trophic interactions sediments present along
reigous creek are flushed away during the intensive rainfall
events that characterize the mediterranean climate of this re 
gion generally in spring and fall however the cowg sam 
pling site is located in a small depression and is protected by a
low wall allowing the sediments to remain in place over the
years and could thus sustain the development of more com 
plex communities 

based on pcoa analysis the reigous riverbed sediments
formed a succession of distinct ecosystems hosting contrasted
eukaryotic communities whose structure was linked to sedi 
ment composition the concentration of arsenic in the sedi 
ment was identified as the main factor controlling the compo 
sition of the eukaryotic community a high level of as being
associated with low eukaryotic diversity in addition to arse 
nic pearson’s correlation revealed that s zn and pb were
also significantly correlated with the composition of the eu 
karyotic community in accordance with our results the pres 
ence of other heavy metals zn cu ni has been previously
suggested to shape eukaryotic community diversity and bio 
mass in the río tinto more than the influence of ph a
recent study suggested that seasonality associating light in 
tensity and water temperature significantly influences eukary 
otic distribution in amd biofilms 

distinct mineralogical conditions were evidenced in this
study they impacted the microbial assemblages in carnoulès
sediments andmay have selected specific communities adapted
to the local environmental properties these selected commu 
nities probably influence biogeochemical processes and eco 
system functioning as an illustration the most abundant
otu retrieved from the as rich sediments s gal and
galm belonged to the genus rhodotorula which is known

to be involved in arsenic cycling this genus was not
detected at other sites characterized by a lower concentration
of as revealing a possible selective effect of arsenic 

the present study showed that eukaryotic community
structure and composition both responds to and impacts eco 
system characteristics to gain insight into the specific contri 
bution of eukaryotes in carnoulès ecosystem functioning 
further characterizations of the species their mode of nutrition
 autotrophy heterotrophy mixotrophy their interactions
 food web saprotrophism parasitism commensalism etc 
are now required the capacity of eukaryotic microorganisms
to interact with arsenic thereby impacting the fate of arsenic in
the aquatic ecosystem also requires future investigation the
potential for arsenic methylation was recently evidenced in
reigous creek and the river amous since
eukaryotes fungi algae etc are known for their biometh 
ylation capacity targeting this microbial function to
assess its contribution to arsenic cycling in amd impacted
water will be of particular interest
