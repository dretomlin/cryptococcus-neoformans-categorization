marine microbes along with microeukaryotes are key regulators of
oceanic biogeochemical pathways here we present a high resolution
 every ° of latitude dataset describing microbial pro and eukary 
otic richness in the surface and just below the thermocline along a
 km transect from °s at the antarctic ice edge to the equator
in the south pacific ocean the transect conducted in austral winter 
covered key oceanographic features including crossing of the polar
front pf the subtropical front stf and the equatorial upwelling
region our data indicate that temperature does not determine pat 
terns of marine microbial richness complementing the global model
data from ladau et al ladau j et al isme j – 
rather nh 

 nanophytoplankton and primary productivity were
the main drivers for archaeal and bacterial richness eukaryote rich 
ness was highest in the least productive ocean region the tropical
oligotrophic province we also observed a unique diversity pattern in
the south pacific ocean a regional increase in archaeal and bacterial
diversity between °s and the equator rapoport’s rule describes the
tendency for the latitudinal ranges of species to increase with lati 
tude our data showed that the mean latitudinal ranges of archaea
and bacteria decreased with latitude we show that permanent
oceanographic features such as the stf and the equatorial upwelling 
can have a significant influence on both alpha diversity and beta 
diversity of pro and eukaryotes 

prokaryotes eukaryotes rapoport’s rule richness latitude

global climate change is impacting a wide variety of marineecosystems and developing an adequate understanding
of the base of the marine food web including the richness of bac 
teria archaea and hetero mixo and phototrophic eukaryotes 
 is an urgent priority if we are to predict its consequences 
ocean salinity and temperature have been shown to covary with
species distributions suggesting that oceanographic changes can
shift geographic boundaries and alter phenology and community
structures in organisms ranging from bacteria to planktonic eu 
karyotes and to higher trophic levels – alterations in the bio 
geographic patterns of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms
in the upper ocean could impact the efficiency of carbon c fixa 
tion nutrient cycling and ultimately the export of organic c to the
deep ocean as microorganisms are key biogeochemical regulators
 
much literature agrees on the consistent increase in richness

from the poles toward the equator for all major groups of ter 
restrial aquatic and marine taxa see hillebrand we note
that there are exceptions such as pinnipeds which peak at higher
latitudes however diversity patterns for prokaryotic and
unicellular eukaryotic organisms were underrepresented in
the latitudinal gradients assembled from the literature by
hillebrand the latter noted that diversity gradients weaken
when eukaryotic size decreases and that no gradients at all are
expected when data are extrapolated to unicellular organisms 
the large population sizes and high transportability along with
rapid generation times for prokaryotes and unicellular eukary 

otes increase the probability for repeated short term reestab 
lishment of populations in new habitats 
a growing body of evidence however suggests that pelagic

marine microorganisms can exhibit large scale biogeographical
patterns that resemble those of multicellular macroorganisms
 – the findings of pommier et al and fuhrman et al 
 showed that marine planktonic bacterial richness is corre 
lated with temperature on a global scale ladau et al ’s 
model outputs suggest that marine bacterial richness has a sea 
sonal peak during the boreal and austral winters at temperate
latitude the work by gilbert et al complemented the
changes in diversity with season reported by ladau et al 
the former concluded from a study spanning y that bacterial
richness peaked during winter in the english channel their
results highlighted that seasonal changes in environmental pa 
rameters with day length explaining of the variance are in
some cases more important than trophic interactions 

significance

high resolution data covering marine microbes and micro 
eukaryotes are sparse even though these organisms control
global biogeochemical cycles here we present a dataset de 
scribing the microbial pro and eukaryotic diversity along a
 km transect from the antarctic ice edge to the equator in
the south pacific ocean we show that i temperature is not a
primary driver of richness gradients ii prokaryotic richness
increases with productivity and iii oceanographic features
can structure the diversity of pro and eukaryotes our data
have given us a better understanding of how diversity re 
lates to dissolved inorganic nitrogen and productivity as well
as insights into the potential shifts in the geographical
range of marine microbe communities in light of the rapidly
changing climate

the mechanisms supporting biodiversity gradients see mittelbach
et al are better understood for larger size taxa and the
controls for marine unicellular pro and eukaryotic diversity
trends remain more elusive due to the paucity of the spatial
resolution here we generated a high resolution dataset
in austral winter describing microbial diversity on the surface
and just below the thermocline along with environmental pa 
rameters every half degree along a km transect spanning
latitudes ∼ °s to °s and temperatures from − °c to °c we
use this dataset to test the hypotheses concerning the ecological
mechanisms controlling pro and eukaryotic richness in the
south pacific ocean that h richness increases with increasing
temperature higher temperatures increase the rates of bio 
chemical and metabolic pathways e g q coefficient and h 
richness increases with increasing productivity more resources
support higher numbers of species mittelbach et al in
addition we hypothesized that h stable fronts and hydrographic
features can act as control mechanisms on microbial assemblages
 structuring of unique microbial oceanic provinces via ecological
boundaries testing these hypotheses has given us a better under 
standing of how pro and eukaryotic richness relates to ecosystem
processes such as primary productivity as well as insights into the
potential shifts in the geographical range of marine microbe
communities in light of the rapidly changing global climate 

results
physical and biochemical data from the ice edge to the equator sea
surface temperatures increased gradually from − °c to °c
between °s and the equator fig a–c colder waters at a
depth of ∼ m near the equator showed a clear signal indicating
equatorial upwelling fig c lowest salinities were measured in
the southern latitudes with values around practical salinity
units psu while they reached their maximum around °s at
about psu prominent features along the p s go ship
transect are the polar front pf ∼ °s and the subtropical
front stf ∼ °s gray rectangles in fig c and d the pf
separates the sub antarctic waters from the antarctic circumpolar
waters the stf separates the colder less saline and nutrient rich
sub antarctic waters of the southern ocean from the warmer and
saltier subtropical waters fig c and d clear temperature

both temperature and salinity increased when passing the stf
 from to °c and from to psu respectively

the slope for the eukaryotes was very weak however and showed

with the steepest increases in the southern ocean covering both
the pf and stf and near the equatorial upwelling fig d–f 
heatmaps of the most abundant otus for all domains confirmed
strong differences in community composition in the different bi 
omes si appendix fig s in the archaeal domain a key finding
was a high abundance of nitrifying organisms such as candidatus
nitrosopumilus and nitrosopelagicus in the southern ocean 
overall we saw clear changes in the archaeal beta diversity but 
because the taxonomy for archaea is not as well resolved as for the
bacterial domain most of the dominant archaeal otus belonged to
thermoplasmatales marine group ii in the bacterial domain 
sequences from sar clade a sar rickettsiales thio 
globaceae planktomarina and pseudoaltermonas revealed an
abundant presence in the southern ocean the flavobacteriaceae 
marinimicrobia syncechococcus cc and candidatus actino 
marina showed a higher abundance in the stf procholoroccus 
sar claded iv and ib deltaproteobacteria and candidatus
actinomarina on the other hand showed a high abundance in the
tropical biomes fig key findings for the eukaryotic domain
were a high abundance of dinophyceae and copepoda in the
southern ocean and stf along with a high presence of phaeocystis
 which was also visually confirmed by a bloom in the southern
ocean we also noted a very high read abundance of collodaria 
phylum radiolaria copepods also showed a high read abundance
in the tropical oligotrophic and the equatorial regions

primary driver of richness gradients complementing the global
model data from ladau et al h archaeal and bacterial
richness increased significantly with productivity and h 
oceanographic features such as fronts and upwelling can in 
fluence pro and eukaryotic richness our data complement the
work by ladau et al and gilbert et al and because of
our high resolution spatial sampling add to our understanding of
the marine microbial diversity in ways that were not possible with
previous datasets 
overall archaeal bacterial and eukaryotic richness were all

positively correlated to each other and displayed bimodal dis 
tributions along our transect bounded by key oceanographic
features including the pf the stf and the equatorial upwelling
region these physical features were associated with strong
changes in temperature salinity dissolved inorganic n concen 
trations and po 

 − concentrations both archaeal and bacterial
richness peaked at borders of the stf and near the equatorial
upwelling archaea and bacteria were significantly correlated
with primary productivity in these regions these results show
that permanent oceanographic features such as the stf and the
equatorial upwelling region can act as ecological boundaries 
our data suggest a different latitudinal trend in archaeal and

bacterial diversity than previously thought ladau et al 
predicted a decrease in winter from ∼ ° toward the equator to
the best of our knowledge no research has shown or modeled
the steady increase for both archaea and bacteria toward the
equatorial upwelling region it is worth noting that the increase
in eukaryotic richness toward the equator was more modest than

that seen in archaea and bacteria our findings also show that
temperature is not as suggested on a global scale by ladau et al 
 a primary driver for pro or eukaryotic richness in the south
pacific ocean these findings complement those from marañón
et al who showed that variability in phytoplankton growth
is driven by changes in resource supply rather than by seawater
temperature boosted regression trees analysis showed that
patterns of archaeal and bacterial richness in the surface waters
could be largely explained by salinity a main identifier for fronts
along our transect and by nh 

 the nanophytoplankton frac 
tion and primary productivity 
the nanophytoplankton fraction was dominated by dinophyceae

and prymnesiophytes which reaffirms that these groups
could be an important player in co fixation as mentioned by
jardillier et al in subtropical and tropical ecosystems 
nh 

 is a preferred substrate for a wide range of organisms and
the link between nh 

 and primary productivity is explained
below in more detail the nanophytoplankton fraction showed
the strongest positive correlation with productivity of the three
phytoplanktonic size fractions overall our data suggest that
further exploration of whether primary productivity supports
greater richness or whether a higher richness stimulates greater
primary productivity would be useful 
eukaryotic richness was influenced up to by salinity and

si in the surface waters and by si alone just below the mld 
these data suggest that eukaryotic richness is strongly controlled
by the sharp abiotic inflection points seen near the oceano 
graphic features in the south pacific ocean and again that

oceanographic features can structure eukaryotic richness as seen
elsewhere the negative correlation with si also suggests
that a more diverse eukaryotic community depletes the si from
the water 
richness for all domains was higher just below the mld 

which is supported by the global data analysis of ladau et al 
in which proximity to the nutricline also a hot spot for organic
and inorganic particle accumulation was presented as a
strong predictor for bacterial richness in particular particles
and marine aggregates often at fronts and at density interfaces
such as the mld are able to provide extra niches such as an 
aerobic microhabitats in oxygenated waters for prokaryotes 
which in turn can increase their diversity near the equatorial
upwelling relatively elevated no 

− and nh 
 concentrations

coincided with higher primary productivity rates note that no 
−

and nh 
 concentrations were also high in the southern ocean 

but there iron limits primary productivity near the
equator no 

− nh 
 and oxygen showed positive relationships

with archaeal richness 
oceanographic fronts are generally characterized by a transi 

tion between mixed and stratified waters and we suggest that
they can act as ecological boundaries for pro and eukaryotes in
the ocean as supported by recent research oceanographic
features such as the stf and the equatorial upwelling region 
stimulate primary productivity which drives enhanced recycling
processes such as ammonification and nh 

 oxidation 
fronts provide a source of buoyancy through mesoscale and
submesoscale instabilities which enhance nutrient supply
 via upwelling and light availability through mixing salt

fingering which occurs when warm salty water intrudes into
cooler and fresher water could also clearly be noted in the stf
 fig d here layers of warm salty subtropical water intrude
into the cooler and fresher southern ocean waters salt fingers
have the capacity to transport dissolved organic matter and
nutrients horizontally and vertically through molecular and
turbulence driven diffusivities this can play an impor 
tant role in the supply of new n which stimulates phytoplankton
productivity and eukaryotic richness as seen in our dataset and
by others these results complement reports that productive
 high fertility regions support a greater richness as seen in
regional studies in the eastern indian ocean 
fronts are also zones of seasonal convergences which

lead to the passive accumulation of organic material e g high
biomass and particle loads see si appendix fig s this in turn
increases the recycling of particulate organic material and dis 
solved organic material through bacterial degradation 
these processes will increase the no 

− and nh 
 concentra 

tions which in our data could clearly be noted near the stf and
near the equatorial upwelling where we measured elevated
nh 

 concentrations and high chlorophyll a concentrations we
note that the highest primary productivity rates near the stf
were measured at low nh 

 concentrations as expected because
nh 

 is rapidly assimilated and as also confirmed by the negative
spearman correlation it is interesting that dissolved inorganic
nutrients showed a negative correlation with productivity except
in the equatorial upwelling whereas pro and eukaryotic rich 
ness was positively correlated with productivity these findings
suggest that the conversion rates of resources to biomass is more

important than the resources themselves increasing productiv 
ities were noted near two key oceanographic features along the
p transect the stf and the equatorial upwelling near the
equatorial upwelling the positive correlation of nh 

 with pro 
karyotic richness can be related to increased eukaryotic primary
productivity we note that we did not see distinct changes in
the primary productivity rates or in the beta diversity when we
crossed the pf 
within each oceanic province pro and eukaryotic richness

increased linearly within the – nmol c·l− ·h− productivity
range and richness saturated at higher primary productivity 
productive ecosystems have been reported to support high spe 
cies richness in our data we note that eukaryotic richness
was highest in the least productive oceanic province the tropical
oligotrophic region eukaryotic diversity increased from the
polar waters to the stf overall richness did not peak at the
highest productivity rate measurements a possible explanation
is that productive regions tend to be associated with lower
eukaryotic diversity possibly due to being dominated by fast 
growing organisms which can outcompete other species
through resource competition generally we need more
information to disentangle the question whether primary pro 
ductivity controls richness or whether higher richness stimulates
greater primary productivity 

we observed clear patterns in the richness across the three
domains alpha diversity but also in the diversity among com 
munities beta diversity from south to north we noted distinct
differences in the community structures and in the abundance of
distinct genera for the pro and eukaryotic domains in the dif 
ferent biomes our data showed that oceanographic boundaries
can constrain beta diversity gradients in the south pacific ocean 
overall we noted strong differences among all biomes except
between the tropical oligotrophic region and the equatorial up 
welling interestingly our high resolution data revealed an in 
crease in the latitudinal ranges from the most southern to the
most northern stations for the archaea and bacteria the mean
latitudinal ranges of archaea and bacteria decreased with in 
creasing latitude thus not supporting the existence of a rapoport’s
effect in early winter in the south pacific ocean rapoport’s rule
suggests that range sizes are larger near the poles and decrease near
the equator amend et al and sul et al did confirm a
global rapoport’s effect for marine bacterioplankton gaston et al 
 and rohde on the other hand note that the rapoport’s
rule is a strictly local phenomenon our data do show a latitudinal
trend but one opposite the reports in the current literature these
data especially in the southern ocean where the latitudinal range
was the smallest highlight the strong need to understand the cor 
relations between the different biotic and abiotic parameters that

structure marine pro and eukaryotic richness so we can build a
mechanistic understanding of patterns of global marine microbial
diversity the southern ocean is a region that stands out as a
sentinel for responses to climate change changes in the
physical and biogeochemical properties of the southern ocean 
will likely impact pro and eukaryotic richness and thereby vital
ecosystem services therefore a good understanding of the alpha 
and beta diversity at the base of the food web is of important 
taxonomic heatmaps demonstrated strong differences in com 

munity structure and revealed that distinct taxa for all domains were
present in the different oceanographic biomes the alphaproteo 
bacteria and in particular the sar clades showed distinct dif 
ferences in the southern ocean the stf and the tropical
oligotrophic biomes as also seen by others across frontal zones
in the southern ocean from a functional ecosystem perspective
the higher read abundance of nitrifying archaeal organisms in the
southern ocean raises the interesting question of whether we can
link nitrification rates to these higher abundances in the southern
ocean in the eukaryotic domain the calanoida showed different
genera across and at opposing ends of the transect copepods have
been used as an indicator of changes in ocean and climate condi 
tions continued high resolution dna sampling along re 
peated transect lines in the ocean using different eukaryotic
marker genes see the topic of environmental dna could
potentially help in teasing apart differences in community structures
in response to climatic changes 

conclusion
our high resolution data gave insights into the trends in pro and
eukaryotic richness along a vast latitudinal transect complementing
the model data of ladau et al showing that temperature is not
always a prime control in richness gradients here we show that
archaeal and bacterial diversity increases from around °s to the
equator and that the richness of these domains shows a strong and
positive correlation with primary productivity these results update
the findings of pommier et al and fuhrman et al in which
bacterial richness was only weakly related to primary productivity
 which was calculated from satellite data our data showed that
permanent oceanographic features can act as ecological boundaries
which can influence pro and eukaryotic richness as reported by
zinger et al wilkins et al amend et al wolf et al 
 and baltar and arístegui interestingly our high resolution
data did not confirm the effect of rapoport’s rule in early winter in
the south pacific ocean our data showed that the mean latitudinal
ranges of archaea and bacteria decreased with latitude overall our
data support a potential link between productivity and diversity
gradients and highlight the need for more information on how local
environmental forces can modulate the correlation between di 
versity and productivity within ocean provinces
