maquis is a dense evergreen shrub layer which in semi arid mediterranean lands is

commonly linked to the presence of well conserved soils with large contents of mineraliz 

able substrates it was our aim to test whether i maquis promotes soil microbial biomass

and activity and ii mature pine plantations without a shrubby understory support

microbial biomass and activity levels comparable to those of stands with maquis surface

soil samples were taken in four sites that sustain pine plantations pp maquis with pines

 mp maquis mq and grasslands gs microbial biomass was inferred from the c content in

the soil microbiota the atp content in fresh samples and the co –c production from

incubated samples were used to assess microbial activity as was the activity of b gluco 

sidase and alkaline phosphatase topsoils under maquis mp and mq were the most fertile 

both chemically high organic carbon contents and physically low bulk density high

aggregate stability and showed by far the largest levels of microbial biomass and activity 

these levels in soils under pp which sustained a successful plantation in terms of tree

canopy density but lacked the shrubby understory were significantly smaller than those of

the adjacent shrubland with pines mp redundancy analysis extracted a main axis

explaining of the variation of the microbiological soil properties which was interpreted

as an environmental gradient of soil fertility along this axis the samples were separated

according to the presence or absence of a maquis dominated by late successional species 

other factors such as soil type slope position and aspect were less influential the effects of

afforestation practices on the detritus based system should be considered in the design of

future forest restoration strategies in desertification threatened lands

traditional landscape restoration has neglected the main

role that the maquis plays within the ecosystem costa 

indeed practices such as removing the flammable maquis are

commonly used to reduce the spread of fire and facilitate fire

control leone et al moreover for many decades forest

rehabilitation in the western mediteranean areas has relied on

plantation of aleppo pine which is a pioneer species that can

grow rapidly under a range of conditions barbéro et al 

olarieta et al schiller however a handful of

studies have shown that pine plantations do not restore the

physical and chemical soil properties maestre and cortina 

 nowadays more and more research deals with the

feasibility of replanting the shrub layer maestre et al 

azcón aguilar et al caravaca et al and ecological

criteria are increasingly claimed as the basis to be used for the

design of restoration programmes achieving such restoration

requires a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem

functioning but the detritus based system is neglected

despite its unique role in the performance of ecosystems

 young et al 

in the forest soil inventory drawn up in alacant province

 southeastern spain in which a total of soil profiles were

investigated we observed that the presence of mollisols i e 

highly developed soils with a mollic horizon is commonly

linked to a well conserved maquis sánchez mollic

horizons are dark spongy and crumb structured surface

mineral horizons with a high organic c content which confer

on soils their physical and chemical fertility as well as water

infiltration and buffering capacity more widespread are the

inceptisols i e young or rejuvenated soils in which mineral

particles have been altered or removed to some extent which

appeared under a broader range of plant covers including

mature pine plantations these supply lower amounts of

organic matter into the topsoil conditioning the formation of

ochric epipedions which are rather pale massive and hard 

these observations led us to hypothesise that i soils

under maquis might shelter the largest and metabolically

most active microbial communities and ii the microbial

biomass and activity levels in soils under mature planted

pinewoods which lack a shrub layer might be smaller than

those of the well conserved soils under maquis to test these

hypotheses we selected a small area including four soil types 

which are representative of the semi arid mediterranean

region of southeastern spain soil physical and chemical

properties as well as soil microbial biomass and activity were

quantified in two mollisols sustaining maquis with pines and

maquis and two inceptisols covered with pine plantations

and patchy grasslands

 soil sampling

a stratified random sampling was designed to analyse the

variability within and between sites crépin and johnson 

 in each site three m � m plots were randomly
established several tens to hundreds meters apart in july

 november and april soil samples were taken

from the top cm in each plot a total of samples were

collected four sites � three plots � three dates each one
consisting of a mixture of ten homogenised sub samples ca 

 g each in pp mp and mq the sub samples were randomly

chosen as x y coordinates over a m square fixed grid in

each plot in gs in which soil samples were taken below the s 

tenacissima canopy all the plant clumps within each plot were

numbered and ten of them randomly selected the sampling

was designed taking care to avoid previously disturbed soil 

samples were stored at c and taken to the laboratory 

visible plant residues and roots were removed and fresh soil

 discussion

 the effect of maquis on soil microbial communities

the closed maquis in mp and mq supplied a thick organic

layer that represented an important organic c input into the

topsoil compared to that from other plant covers fig 

furthermore the soil physical and chemical properties

suggested that pine plantation pp and grassland gs soils

had more mechanisms for soil organic carbon soc protection

against microbial decomposition than soils under maquis mp

and mq first physical compaction i e higher bulk density 

which reduces oxygen availability franzluebbers and

hampers soc accessibility amelung and zech tended

to be higher in pp and gs table second these soils had

higher amounts of carbonates which reduce the solubility of

organic matter preventing it from microbial attack baldock

and skjemstad 

therefore the presence of maquis improved the physical

and chemical soil properties creating a favourable environ 

ment for soil microbes as their high biomass and activity

levels reflected figs and this can be visualized in the

ordination diagram resulting from redundancy analysis

 fig rda extracted a main ordination axis that can be

interpreted as an environmental gradient of soil physical and

chemical fertility both sites with maquis were located at the

high fertility pole of the axis i e high organic carbon contents

and aggregate stability low bulk density which was

associated to high levels of all the microbiological parameters 

and were separated from sites with pine plantations and

grasslands on the other hand all sites behaved similarly

along the second ordination axis which can be regarded as a

gradient of soil humidity and temperature environmental

conditions in april were the most favourable for microbial

activity as the atp content extracted from the samples under

field moisture conditions reflected enhanced production of

phosphatase was highly correlated with the greater microbial

activity responding to the higher p demands in summer a

maximum in water soluble c wsc was detected which was

correlated with cmic and co production the correlation

between the wsc content in the soil solution and the soil

temperature has been reported before andersson and

nilsson however rewetting the extremely dry samples

collected in summer for their incubation in the laboratory can

physically disrupt soil aggregates thus making wsc more

accessible pulleman and tietema 

interestingly both sites with maquis present either as a

pinewood understory or as the main plant layer had similar

soil physical and chemical properties as well as microbial

biomass and activity levels despite the fact that site selection

criteria were used to maximise differences among them

 table three factors could have been responsible for higher

soc levels in mp compared to mq first the pine cover present

in the former second the slope position since mp and mq

were at transportation and erosional positions respectively 

this factor exerts a marked control on soil moisture
 gómez plaza et al and soc dynamics norton et al 

 thus influencing the microbially driven soil processes

 garcı́a et al bergstrom et al finally the slope

aspect mp and mq were north and south facing respec 

tively which affects the soil climate and the c mineralization

rates raubuch and joergensen these results suggest

that the presence of a well developed maquis overshadows

the effect of other factors that control surface microbial

processes at landscape scale such as soil type plant cover

structure and slope position and aspect parkin 

 soil microbial communities under pine plantations

to test whether the microbial biomass and activity levels in

soils under mature planted pinewoods were comparable to

those of well conserved soils under maquis the adjacent sites

pp and mp were compared typic calcixerepts in pp and typic

calcixerolls in mp were pedogenetically equivalent i e they

were developed in the same northern backslopes from

colluvial deposits which permitted a significant percolation

of organic matter into the upper meter and showed a

progressive increase in identifiable secondary carbonates

with depth however decades of tilling rejuvenated the

former soils mainly through the mineralization of the organic

matter and the homogenization of the topsoil properties after

discontinuation of cultivation pp was reforested ca years

ago with a pine monoculture which is successful in terms of

tree growth and canopy density 

semi arid mediterranean abandoned lands undergo a

substantial regeneration of the plant species richness and

percentage cover of the woody shrubland bonet this

natural regeneration has a positive effect on soil quality 

leading to the recovery of soil organic carbon microbial

biomass and activity after years garcı́a et al 

however in the formerly cultivated site pp where a pine

plantation substituted for the natural recovery of the shrub 

land the topsoil organic carbon content was not comparable

to those of the adjacent shrubland area mp fig these

results agree with previous findings as reviewed by maestre

and cortina the depleted topsoil fertility in pp as

compared to mp accounts for its smaller and less active

microbial communities figs and neither pp’s microbial

metabolic capabilities measured as the ability to consume a

range of c sources nor its genetic resources analysed

separating amplified s rrna genes using denaturing

gradient gel electrophoresis were comparable to those of

mp goberna et al contrary to our results rutigliano

et al described a similar microbial functioning of two

sub humid mediterranean sandy soils under planted pine 

woods and maquis with pines in burned areas 
 conclusions

mediterranean maquis dominated by late successional spe 

cies ameliorated the soil’s chemical and physical fertility 

creating an environment that promoted microbial biomass

and activity soils under a closed maquis presented largercmic 

atp content microbial respiration and c and p catalytic

abilities which were equivalent regardless of differences in



a p p l i e d s o i l e c o l o g y – 
other main factors i e soil type slope position and aspect 

plant cover structure these results confirmed the hypothesis

that soils under maquis would hold larger and metabolically

more active microbial communities than soils under other

plant covers that are common over the western mediterranean

lands furthermore soils under a mature pine plantation

presented markedly smaller and less active microbial com 

munities that were similar to those present in grassland soils 

as compared to the semi natural stands with maquis the

reforested area cannot be said to have restored the microbially

driven ecosystem functions
