abstract

aims in this study the species indicator test was used to identify key

bacterial taxa affected by changes in the soil environment as a result of

conservation agriculture or conventional practices 

methods and results soils cultivated with wheat triticum spp l and maize

 zea mays l under different raised bed planting systems for years that is 

varying crop residue and fertilizer management were used taxonomic and

divergence based s metagenomics and indval analysis were used to study

the bacterial communities and identify indicator taxa genus and otu 

affected by agricultural practices although some phyla were affected

significantly by different treatments the taxonomic assemblages at phylum

level were similar bacterial taxa related to different processes of the n cycle

were indicators of different fertilization rates for example azorhizobium 

nostoc and nitrosomonas a large number of otu were indicators for

conventionally tilled beds and their distribution was defined by soil organic

carbon indval analysis identified different taxa in each of the residue

management systems this suggests that although the same organic material

remains in the field crop residue management affects specific taxa the taxa

indicator of the burned residues belonged mainly to the order sbr 

 anaerolineae chloroflexi and the genera bacillus and alicyclobacillus 

conclusions n fertilizer application rates affected n cycling taxa tillage

affected actinobacteria members and organic matter decomposers although

the same crop residue was retained in the field organic material management

was important for specific taxa 

significance and impact of the study in this study we report that

agricultural practice affected soil bacterial communities we also identified

distinctive taxa and related their distribution to changes in the soil

environment resulting from different agricultural practices 

introduction

the effect of agricultural management practices on soil

bacterial communities is of great importance as soil bac 

teria are critical to maintaining soil fertility soil bacteria

participate in most biological soil processes including

nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition

 postma blaauw et al ollivier et al chaparro

et al nicolas et al agricultural systems like

all ecosystems depend on microbial mediated processes

for c and n cycling and overall sustainability osler and

sommerkorn govaerts et al it is well known

that agricultural management practices e g tillage crop

residue management crop rotation fertilization and irri 

gation affect physico chemical soil characteristics

 a b aziz et al jat et al and it is there 

fore expected that they affect soil microbial communities 

a large number of studies have investigated the effect

of agricultural practices on size composition and func 

tionality of bacterial communities mostly in long term

field experiments with a wide range of crops in different

soils and climates acosta martinez et al helgason

et al meriles et al ceja navarro et al 

wess�en et al vargas gil et al chaudhry

et al kihara et al lupwayi et al wang

et al navarro noya et al independent of

the molecular techniques used these studies all reported

that agricultural practices have an effect on microbial

communities in soil for instance tilled soil favoured dif 

ferent bacterial groups compared to no tilled soil cae 

sar tonthat et al schneider et al kihara

et al lupwayi et al navarro noya et al 

 and the application of n fertilizer favoured copi 

otrophic bacterial taxa wess�en et al fierer et al 

 a 

most of these studies discussed changes in commu 

nity composition and or the increase or decrease in the

relative abundance of high ranking taxonomic groups 

that is phylum or class however little is known on

how agricultural practices affect lower ranking taxo 

nomic taxa that is at the genus or species level these

lower ranking taxonomic taxa define the bacterial com 

munities in this study we extended the bacterial com 

munity analysis by identifying key taxa that define the

bacterial community structure and by correlating these

key taxa with changes in the physico chemical soil

properties resulting from different agricultural practices 

we investigated three agricultural practices raised bed

planting systems tilled raised beds and permanent

raised beds levels of residue retention full and partial

retention or incorporation of crop residue and two

application rates of inorganic n fertilizer or

 kg n ha� in a year long term field experi 
ment wheat triticum spp l and maize zea mays

l were cultivated in rotation and soil was sampled

when maize was grown the effect of residue burning a

traditional agricultural practice still common in many

parts of the world including mexico was also included

 verhulst et al although burning of crop resi 

dues facilitates seeding prevents crop diseases and con 

trols weeds it causes considerable loss of organic

carbon c n and other nutrients wang et al 

the objective of this study was to identify key taxa

affected by different agricultural practices and use taxo 

nomic phylogenetic and operational taxonomic units

affect the overall community structure

lineales chloroflexi have been found abundantly in active

sludge and other nutrient rich environments yoon et al 

 and utilizing decaying anammox bacterial cell mate

indicators for the –n and –n fertilizer treatments 
whereas chloronema and a yet to be cultured tk were

indicators for the –n fertilizer treatments members of
the anaerolineae and thermomicrobia were indicators for

the –n fertilizer treatments the relationship between
different groups of chloroflexi in soil under different n

fertilization rates further highlights their potential ecologi 

cal role in agroecosystems it is also likely that the n fertil 

izer application stimulates micro organisms capable of

mineralizing organic material such as the actinomycetales

the soil aggregates increases soil compaction erosion 

desiccation and loss of organic material altering micro 

bial interactions lupwayi et al zero tillage and

residue retention improve soil aeration reduce tempera 

ture and moisture fluctuations increase carbon content

in the surface soil and water is retained longer in these

soils govaerts et al zero tillage using bed systems

reduces compaction in the rooting zone by confining

wheel traffic to the furrow bottoms the bed system also

enables farmers to use a variety of weed and fertilizer

management practices hobbs et al studies in

other agroecosystems found that tillage is the agricultural

practice that affects the bacterial community structure the

most kihara et al lupwayi et al in this

study a large number of otu emerged as an indicator

taxa for conventionally tilled beds belonging to differ 

ent taxonomic groups including acidobacteria armati 

monadetes gemmatimonadetes and chloroflexi whereas

for permanent raised beds they were mainly members of

actinobacteria actinomycetospora clavibacter mycobac 

terium sphaerisporangium the distribution of the phyla

represented by the indicator taxa for conventional beds

resembled the distribution of the overall bacterial com 

munities indicating that tillage affects the overall com 

munity as previously mentioned actinobacteria are

organic matter decomposers and were abundant in per 

manent raised beds in another field experiment at cim 

myt but in the central highlands of mexico the relative

abundance of actinobacteria also increased in zero tillage

systems navarro noya et al 

crop residue management can affect soil quality posi 

tively or negatively intensive cropping systems are

diverse so no single residue management system is best

for all conditions the best crop residue management

should be selected to increase crop yields with the least

adverse effect on the environment it has been suggested

that in each cropping system both the constraints for

production and sustainability should be identified for the

development of the best system kumar and goh 

residue management changed the physico chemical soil

characteristics and altered the bacterial community struc 

ture the typical effect of residue incorporation reported

is an increase in microbial biomass kallenbach and

 verhulst et al a indval analysis identified different

taxa in each of the residue management systems

 table s indicating that although the same organic

matter is retained in the field management is important

for favouring specific taxa acidobacterial members

emerged as indicator taxa when residue was incorporated

or partially retained and betaproteobacteria environ 

mental species and burkholderiales when residue was

incorporated when residue was partially removed in the

field phylotypes belonging to the gemmatimonadetes

and armatimonadetes appeared as indicator taxa whereas

otu indicators belonged to the different classes of pro 

teobacteria when the entire crop residue was retained in

the field although gemmatimonadetes are ubiquitous in

soil and likely play an important role in terrestrial ecosys 

tems their ecological function is still poorly understood 

gemmatimonadetes in soil depended on moisture avail 

ability and suggested members of this phylum are well

adapted to low moisture conditions but unable however 

to resist moisture fluctuations debruyn et al 

residue left in the field protects the soil from water con 

tent fluctuations 

burning crop residue is still a widely used agricultural

practice it is known to impact physical chemical and

biological soil characteristics goberna et al in

this study it significantly affected the bacterial commu 

nity structure and several bacterial groups for example 

acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes gemmati 

monadetes and verrucomicrobia the taxa indicator of

the burned residues were mainly of the order sbr of

the anaerolineae chloroflexi and the bacillus and alicy 

clobacillus genera it is difficult to explain why the

sbr group is indicator taxa for the burning residue

treatment as there is little information about this group 

although anaerolineae contain thermophilic members

 sekiguchi et al yamada et al their physio 

logical traits are diverse and highly specialized zhou

et al members of the bacillus and alicyclobacillus

are spore forming bacteria so well suited to surviving fire 

bacterial endospores are dormant microbial structures

that are highly resistant to heat desiccation radiation

and chemicals they represent one of the most successful

survival strategies of micro organisms and are formed

when conditions are unfavourable such as environmental

stress burning or starvation nicholson et al 

yang and ponce 

as mentioned previously soil characteristics define the

structure of the bacterial communities although toc

explained the overall bacterial composition other soil

characteristics explained the effect of certain treatments 

for instance ph and ec explained the abundance of

indicator taxa of n fertilizer application rates repeated

fertilizer application increases soil salt content thus

changing ph however the acidobacteria a group highly

sensitive to changes in ph did not emerge as taxa indica 

tor but taxa that participate in the n cycle for example 

nitrogen fixation ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxi 

dation did it is suggested that soil characteristics define

bacteria community’s assemblages at high taxonomic

rank philippot et al however when determining

the effect of gradual changes in soil properties such as

those induced by agricultural practices lower taxonomic

ranks have to be considered
