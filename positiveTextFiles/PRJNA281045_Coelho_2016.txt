abstract

there is growing concern that predicted changes to global ocean chemistry will interact

with anthropogenic pollution to significantly alter marine microbial composition and

function however knowledge of the compounding effects of climate change stressors

and anthropogenic pollution is limited here we used s and s rrna cdna based

activity profiling to investigate the differential responses of selected microbial taxa to

ocean acidification and oil hydrocarbon contamination under controlled laboratory con 

ditions our results revealed that a lower relative abundance of sulphate reducing bacte 

ria desulfosarcina desulfococcus clade due to an adverse effect of seawater acidification
and oil hydrocarbon contamination reduced ph–oil treatment may be coupled to
changes in sediment archaeal communities in particular we observed a pronounced

compositional shift and marked reduction in the prevalence of otherwise abundant oper 

ational taxonomic units otus belonging to the archaeal marine benthic group b and

marine hydrothermal vent group mhvg in the reduced ph–oil treatment con 
versely the abundance of several putative hydrocarbonoclastic fungal otus was higher

in the reduced ph–oil treatment sediment hydrocarbon profiling furthermore revealed
higher concentrations of several alkanes in the reduced ph–oil treatment corroborating
the functional implications of the structural changes to microbial community composi 

tion collectively our results advance the understanding of the response of a complex

microbial community to the interaction between reduced ph and anthropogenic pollu 

tion in future acidified marine environments oil hydrocarbon contamination may alter

the typical mixotrophic and k r strategist composition of surface sediment microbiomes

towards a more heterotrophic state with lower doubling rates thereby impairing the

ability of the ecosystem to recover from acute oil contamination events

introduction

it is now widely accepted that anthropogenic activities

are rapidly altering ocean chemistry doney this

is exemplified by the ongoing reduction in seawater

ph also known as ocean acidification which is caused

by the absorption of excess co by the world’s oceans 

since the preindustrial age the ph of ocean surface

waters has decreased by approximately units by

the end of this century an additional reduction of

 units from current conditions is predicted caldeira

modifications to the global climate marine environ 

ments are increasingly exposed to a wide range of dif 

ferent pollutants oil contamination is one of the most

common and visible forms of marine pollution and is

the cause of considerable long term damage to the mar 

ine environment moreno et al with oil explo 

ration progressively moving to more challenging

environments deeper waters and stormier and icier

seas the risk of major contamination events such as

the deepwater horizon oil spill is increasing jernel€ov

 the deepwater horizon explosion in the

gulf of mexico unleashed an undersea geyser of oil

that released at least million litres of crude oil

 cornwal this is considered one of the worst

environmental disasters in the united states of america

with widespread consequences to the whole ecosystem

 welch five years afterwards although research 

ers are still struggling to understand the full implica 

tions of the oil spill the first signs of recovery are

slowly beginning to appear cornwal welch

 

the study of microbial communities is essential to

understand the implications of these ongoing global

and local anthropogenic perturbations on ecosystem

health and function docherty gutknecht trese 

der et al microorganisms are inherently linked to

the ecosystem functioning due to the roles they play in

mediating the biological fluxes of key elements such as

carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulphur

 s falkowski et al and the degradation of envi 

ronmental pollutants it is therefore important to predict

how microbial communities will react to growing

anthropogenic pressure in the marine environment 

currently there is growing concern about the interac 

tive effects of global climate change and environmental

pollution on microbial communities coelho et al 

 a however knowledge is limited with respect to

the response of these communities to the potentially

compounding effects of global climate change e g 

ocean acidification and local contamination events e g 

oil spills importantly this knowledge will enable us to

predict what type of effect future ocean chemistry sce 

narios will have on ecosystem health after a major con 

tamination event such as the deepwater horizon oil

spill for example several studies have shown that the

response of microbial communities to the deepwater

horizon accident was rapid and robust attenuating

the concentration of low molecular weight aliphatic

and aromatic hydrocarbons kimes et al this

response may however be adversely affected in the

near future if predicted scenarios of reduced seawater

ph hold 

although there is accumulating evidence that these

stressors can interact synergistically russell et al 

and additively roberts et al much of the knowl 

edge of the potential effects derives from experiments

that only assess each stressor independently coelho

et al a given the extensive temporal and spatial

scales of global change understanding the interactions

between climate change and anthropogenic pollution is

a difficult task benton et al recently we

addressed the difficulty of obtaining a mechanistic

understanding of these interactions in coastal marine

environments coelho et al b we developed a

microcosm framework capable of simulating the effects

of climate change and pollution on marine sediment

microbial communities this system was further used to

implement a multifactor experiment to characterize the

sensitivity of sediment bacterial communities to envi 

ronmental disturbances coelho et al our results

showed that the interaction between reduced seawater

ph and oil contamination significantly affected sedi 

ment bacterial assemblages causing among other

things a marked reduction in the relative abundance of

anaerobic oil hydrocarbon degrading desulfobacterales

 coelho et al however the implications of this

interaction on the whole microbial community

 prokaryotes and microeukaryotes remain unclear in

addition to external factors microbial communities also

depend on internal interactions among different

domains such as metabolite exchanges bacteria and

archaea or predator–prey interactions microeukaryotes
and bacteria fuhrman et al therefore for a bet 

ter understanding of the deeper implications of the

interactive effects of reduced seawater ph and oil con 

tamination on coastal ecosystems the response of other

key microbial groups such as archaea and microeukary 

otes must be taken into consideration in this study we

hypothesized that the compounding effects of ocean

acidification and environmental contamination with oil

hydrocarbons will have significant effects at various

levels of microbial community organization bacteria 

archaea and microeukaryotes with potential to

adversely affect ecosystem function to test this hypoth 

esis we determined the integrated response of the

whole sediment microbiome to the independent and

combined effects of reduced seawater ph and oil con 

tamination in estuarine sediment microcosms our main

goals were to identify microbial taxa and populations

that may be affected by reduced ph and or oil contam 

ination and to assess possible associations between dif 

ferent microbial groups 

materials and methods

this study benefits from a large microcosm experiment

results and discussion

 s and s cdna amplicon sequencing analysis

in recent years the vast majority of studies that have

characterized microbial communities included targeted

amplicon sequencing of informative markers such as

the ribosomal small subunit kuczynski et al 

although this approach allowed determining the iden 

tity of microorganisms at an unprecedented level of

detail it has inherent limitations several bioinformatics

methods have been developed to reduce the number of

chimeric sequences however such processing does not

eliminate biases such as the switching of tags among

amplicons during library preparation carlsen et al 

 nevertheless it is unlikely that such errors

affected the patterns detected in this study high 

throughput sequencing errors are more critical when

exploring specific questions within a community al 

pha diversity than when testing relationships among

samples beta diversity ley et al such errors

would be furthermore of the same magnitude across

samples with a consequently low impact on diversity

f r

 p the lower relative
abundance of the desulfosarcina desulfococcus clade

under reduced ph and oil contamination could be

linked to the susceptibility of sulphate reducing bacteria

to low ph levels metabolic products of anaerobic

microorganisms such as h s and organic acids are

potentially toxic at low ph koschorreck as the

speciation of free sulphide depends on the system’s ph 

a reduction in ph can play a role in sulphide driven

inhibition of microbial sulphate reduction due to the tox 

icity of h s species hao et al this effect could be

exacerbated at high concentration of oil hydrocarbons 

the lower abundance of sulphate reducing bacteria of

can utilize electrons from hydrogen sulphide that is pro 

duced during the anaerobic metabolism of hydrocarbons

in contaminated environments kim crowley of

note is the observation that groups apparently affected

by the interaction between reduced seawater ph and oil

contamination were all involved in the sulphur cycle 

the pco analysis of the mhvg and mbgb clades

also showed that the phoi treatment contained a com 

positionally distinct archaeal community fig b d sev

due to i an independent effect on bacteria and archaea

or ii a combined feedback due to metabolic interdepen 

dence metabolic dependencies are a major driver of co 

occurrence groups that can complement their biosyn 

thetic capabilities through metabolite exchange zelez 

niak et al members of the desulforsarcina 

desulfococcus clade are frequently associated with

methanotrophic archaea in syntrophic consortia knittel

 boetius syntrophy a type of metabolic interde 

pendence common in anaerobic environments plays an

important role in controlling the methane flux and qual 

ity of global oil resources for example the anaerobic

oxidation of methane aom assumed to be mediated

by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea and sul 

phate reducing bacteria is responsible for the removal

of almost gt of carbon in the form of methane per

year from marine sediment boetius wenzhofer 

conversely deposits of heavy oil extra oil and bitumen 

which comprise of the world s oil resources are
formed after syntrophic methanogenic consortia metabo 

lize the light alkane and aromatic fraction head et al 

 jones et al mcinerney et al desulfati 

bacillum alkenivorans a sulphate reducer has been shown

to syntrophically degrade hexadecane in coculture with

hydrogenotrophic methanogens callaghan et al 

there is however considerable uncertainty about the

physiology and identity of the microorganisms involved

in this process 

in our study the most abundant otus 
sequences assigned to mhvg and mbgb otus were

similar to organisms obtained from hydrocarbon 

impacted ecosystems for the mhvg class with the

exception of otus and the most abundant otu

were similar to organisms retrieved from hydrocarbon 

impacted environments fig s and table s support 

ing information otus and 

interestingly otus and were highly similar se 

quences similarities of and respectively to

an organism recovered in a study that focused on the

methanogenic degradation of aliphatic and aromatic

hydrocarbons siegert et al we observed a simi 

lar pattern for the mbgb clade with the exception of

otu with several otus similar to organisms col 

lected in oil hydrocarbon impacted environments and

lower relative abundances in the phoi treatment

 fig s and table s supporting information e g 

otus – overall although the
mechanistic basis is unclear the congruent composi 

tional changes of bacterial and archaeal otus related to

organisms in oil contaminated ecosystems suggests a

coupled response due to metabolic interdependence 

in line with the observed shifts in prokaryotic com 

munities the fungal pco analysis showed that samples

from phoi treatment were compositionally distinct

from the rest of the treatments fig however domi 

nant fungal otus revealed an inverse tendency and

were more abundant in the phoi treatment a possible

explanation for this increase in abundance could be

related to an increase in the concentration of oil hydro 

carbons due to a reduction in the abundance of hydro 

carbonoclastic bacteria e g desulforsarcina desulfococcus 

in the phoi treatment in addition to the already dis 

cussed ability of fungi to degrade oil hydrocarbons 

with exception of otu all other otus belonged to

members assigned to the ascomycota phylum known to

comprise several alkane degraders harms et al 

interestingly we found a significant association of pen 

tadecane and fungal composition envfit for st and nd

axes p fig s supporting information how 
ever in contrast to bacterial otus this association was

mainly due to a positive correlation between individual

fungal otus and increased levels of aromatic and ali 

phatic hydrocarbons in phoi microcosms fig s 

supporting information in addition to the concentra 

tion of oil hydrocarbons the shift in fungal composition

can also be related to reduced ph because fungi can

tolerate a wider range of ph conditions than bacteria 

these findings indicate that ocean acidification may

favour increased fungal abundance in coastal sediments

exposed to oil hydrocarbon contamination 

overall the interaction between reduced seawater ph

and oil contamination appears to have selected microbial

oil degraders with different life strategies the higher rel 

ative abundance of fungal and lower relative abundance

of desulforsarcina desulfococcus otus can be placed

within the r k scheme in general r strategists are

adapted to maximize their intrinsic rate of growth when

resources are abundant while k strategists are adapted

to compete and survive when populations are near carry 

ing capacity andrews harris although this

concept is an oversimplification it provides a useful

framework for interpreting the microbial structure shifts

observed in the phoi treatment in soils bacteria and

fungi are generally associated with r and k strategy for

carbon and nutrient use respectively rousk frey

 based on our results we propose that the interac 

tion between ocean acidification and oil contamination

promotes the establishment of some k selected microor 

ganisms in a microhabitat commonly dominated by r 

selected bacteria with possible implications to the capac 

ity of the system to recover from oil spill events 

conclusions

we have shown that reduced seawater ph and oil con 

tamination are significant interactive predictors of

microbial community composition in estuarine sedi 

ment thus emphasizing the need to consider the

interactive in addition to the independent effects of cli 

mate and anthropogenic driven changes on these com 

munities furthermore the sensitivity of several taxa 

across the three domains of life to the tested conditions

highlights the need to consider the whole microbiome

when studying climate change and anthropogenic pol 

lution scenarios in line with this necessity there is a

gap in our current knowledge as to how archaeal com 

munities will cope with climate change which should

be addressed in mechanistic studies in the future 

although the presumed coupled response of archaea

and bacteria is supported by existing knowledge the

limited information on archaeal physiology and taxon 

omy hampers a full understanding of this interaction

overall our study suggests a reduced abundance of

bacteria and archaea involved in anaerobic oil degrada 

tion and an increase in the relative abundance of fungal

degraders in microcosms simulating a scenario of ocean

acidification and a punctual oil contamination event con 

sidering the chemical analysis and the underlying meta 

bolic capacity of these groups it may be assumed that the

increase in aerobic eukaryotic degradation will not bal 

ance the reduction in anaerobic prokaryotic degradation 

this shift in the typical mixotrophic and k r strategist

composition of surface sediment microbiomes towards a

more heterotrophic state with lower doubling rates can

potentially lead to a change in sediment oil degradation
