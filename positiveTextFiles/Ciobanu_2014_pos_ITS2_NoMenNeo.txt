the subsurface realm is colonized by microbial communities to depths of meters below the
seafloor m b sf but little is known about overall diversity and microbial distribution patterns at the
most profound depths here we show that not only bacteria and archaea but also eukarya occur at
record depths in the subseafloor of the canterbury basin shifts in microbial community
composition along a core of nearly km reflect vertical taxa zonation influenced by sediment
depth representatives of some microbial taxa were also cultivated using methods mimicking in situ
conditions these results suggest that diverse microorganisms persist down to m b sf in the
seafloor of the canterbury basin and extend the previously known depth limits of microbial evidence

introduction

in addition to terrestrial and marine near surface
habitats the deep biosphere is considered to be a
third realm for microbial life subseafloor sediments
provide a habitat for large numbers of microbial
cells as revealed by cell counts parkes et al 
or card fish schippers et al although
recent data have shown that the global biomass in
subseafloor sediments is smaller than given by
earlier estimates the deep subseafloor biosphere
still constitutes a large fraction � cells of
earth’s living biomass kallmeyer et al 

the subsurface microbiota is diverse and complex 
hosting metabolically active communities down to
depths of meters below the seafloor m b sf 
as revealed by molecular metagenomic and meta 
transcriptomic studies lipp et al roussel

et al biddle et al pawlowski et al 
 orsi et al a it harbors representatives
from the three domains of life for example numerous
endemic and or as yet uncultured archaea and
bacteria for example inagaki et al orcutt
et al in addition to bacterial endospores
 lomstein et al protists and fungi belonging
to eukarya schippers and neretin edgcomb
et al orsi et al a b occurrence of
capsid encoding organisms has also been confirmed
 engelhardt et al although in subsurface
sediment shallower than m b sf background
molecular data on bacterial and archaeal lineages
exists for example inagaki et al orcutt et al 
 most deep subsurface microorganisms
detected so far were refractory to cultivation sass
and parkes the diversity of deeply buried
microorganisms remains untapped as subseafloor
prokaryotic culturability in most studies is o 
of all microscopically detected cells d’hondt et al 
 remarkably when wide enrichment collec 
tions targeting different physiological groups such
as fermenters sulfate reducers and methanogens
were performed using different subseafloor
sediments these often led to the isolation of the

same few ‘generalist’ bacteria for example batzke
et al in most cases the retrieved bacterial
genera were adapted to a broader spectrum of
environmental conditions for example broad tem 
perature range for growth compared with their
surface counterparts sass and parkes 

so far within subseafloor sediments active
bacteria have been identified down to m b sf 
 bale et al active archaea down to
 m b sf roussel et al and active micro 
eukaryotes down to m b sf orsi et al a 
but we are still eager to know the depth limit of the
deep subsurface biosphere limits to microbial
habitability in subseafloor sediments are set by a
variety of physical and chemical parameters like
temperature ph pressure salinity porosity avail 
ability of energy nutrients and water and maybe
also by age as there was water exchange within the
sediment pores the present study site is not
characterized by particularly extreme conditions
but stands out from sites previously examined by
its depth and low porosity the depth limit of the
deep biosphere remains an important issue to place
bounds on the volume of the subseafloor biosphere
and to guide the search for deep life capabilities 
adaptation and the role of microorganisms in global
nutrient cycles we hypothesized that life could
exist in even deeper sediments if pore space was
sufficient 

in this study we investigated the subsurface
microbial communities from a core of m length

maintained during progressive burial of sediments

enabling them to resist the associated environmental
changes however this hypothesis needs to be
analyzed in detail furthermore similar ssu rrna

similar functions 

impact of potential contaminants on native microbial
populations
contamination is a crucial issue when working with
subseafloor sediments in general contamination
during drilling is still difficult to predict during
iodp expedition the level of contamination
during drilling was evaluated by using fluorescent
microspheres and only samples with no detectable
contamination were kept for microbiological ana 
lyses nevertheless samples without microspheres
are not necessarily uncontaminated smith et al 
 contamination generally decreases from the
exterior to the interior of both sediment and rocks
cores for example lever et al in conse 
quence only the interior of sediment cores and
intact pieces of rocks that had been exposed to
ultraviolet light after washing were used for the
analyses in addition for molecular experiments
deeply frozen samples of cm in diameter were
sterilized by flaming afterwards all possible
contaminations during the wet lab steps have been
strictly controlled and minimized see supplementary
text the cutting edge strategy applied for the
pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analyses allowed
removing potential spurious sequences and otus
likely to contain contaminants by sequencing of
negative controls a duplicate procedure and an
associated bioinformatics pipeline in addition to
these precautions the level of potential contamina 
tion of our samples was estimated by calculating the
number of contaminating cells per gram of sediment
and per gram of sedimentary rock based on the mean
contamination values with drilling fluids and mean
cell abundances in surface waters reported in the
literature the mean potential contamination was
estimated as i ± ml of drilling fluid per
gram for unconsolidated sediments drilled using
advanced piston coring apc and ii ±
 ml g– for rocks collected using rotary core
barrel lever et al considering these
levels of contamination mean cell counts of �
 cells ml– in surface waters in the ocean
 whitman et al and average densities of
 g cm– in sediments and g cm– in sedimen 
tary rocks at site u potential contamination of
the interior of the core sample should be expected
very low with – cells g– of sediment only a
second reported estimate indicates that o cells g– 
of sediment contaminated apc core centers drilled
with joides resolution and that xcb cores were

generally more contaminated with contamination
levels – times higher in xcb cores than in apc
core centers house et al considering these
different estimates of potential contamination the
observed cell counts at site u were – orders
of magnitude higher in the studied samples 
if contamination cannot be excluded in the worst
case non indigenous cells represent only up to of
total cells in the sample therefore it is most likely
that of the counted cells are native to the
sampled sediment rocks this implies that the vast
majority of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic dna
subjected to pyrosequencing was therefore derived
from the sediment native cells by extension assum 
ing that most of the prokaryotic dna extracted from
sediment samples is from native cells the fact that
cultivated bacteria match otus abundant in the
crude sediment samples supports the idea that these
cultivated strains are isolates of native bacteria 
consequently the potential impact of contaminants
on each category of data cell counts molecular data
and cultures is likely very low 

ecological implications and future prospects
we have underlined that the subseafloor of the
canterbury basin hosts microorganisms that com 
prise bacteria archaea and eukarya some of these
microorganisms are alive and at least to a certain
extent revivable the communities exhibit a quite
low phylogenetic diversity but this does not
necessarily correspond to a low functional diversity 
this poor diversity could be explained if natural
selection has produced i taxa adapted to harsh
subsurface conditions that is specialists which
would be expected in the case of a low connectivity
among habitats and or ii taxa with a broad
physiological plasticity allowing them to survive
in a diversity of nutritional and physical–chemical
conditions that is generalists in fact some
taxa detected through their s s rrna
gene sequences are thought to be endemic to
subsurface habitats while others seem ubiquitous
and are consistently encountered in common and
extreme environments the bacterial strains in
cultures are related to opportunistic or generalist
taxa isolated from a broad array of redox environ 
ments which raises the question of the existence of
microbial metabolic versatility and also questions
the species concept as behind a given name or a
given otu can lay a variety of microorganisms with
different ecological lifestyles metabolic versatility
has already been demonstrated in well known taxa 
for example some thermococcales strains which
are usually fermenters that reduce sulfur com 
pounds can grow in oligotrophic conditions or can
oxidize carbon monoxide sokolova et al 
heterotrophy is likely to be the major mode of
carbon assimilation within microbial communities
of subsurface marine sediments batzke et al 
our culture data support this hypothesis genome

size the individual ecological functions within the
analyzed habitat or ecosystem vandenkoornhuyse
et al the detection of fungal sequences at
great depths and our success in the cultivation of
fungal strains leads us to ask what role they play in
deep carbon cycling and what involvement they
have in dynamics regulation of prokaryotic popula 
tions if they are active in situ 

the broad polyphasic approach developed in this
study provides direct evidence that viable micro 
organisms can be present in rocks that are hardened
but not totally cemented where stylolites and micro 
fluid circulations exist our data demonstrate that the
combination of physical chemical and energetic
constraints encountered from – m csf a in
the subseafloor of the canterbury basin still allow
microorganisms to persist down to at least 
and m csf a for archaea fungi and bacteria 
respectively it extends the subseafloor sedimentary
depths at which subseafloor organisms are known to
be present to m for fungi and to m for
bacteria nevertheless one cannot exclude that some
of the detected sequences belong to microorganisms
in dormancy more extensive sequencing efforts will
be required that is direct metatranscriptomics to
describe more directly the microbial communities
along with functional signatures and to compile data
on biogeochemical processes and fluxes
