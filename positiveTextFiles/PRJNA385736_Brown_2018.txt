background summary
bacteria archaea and microbial eukaryotes dominate ocean ecosystems composing of marine
biomass they display a vast phylogenetic and functional diversity and their combined metabolic
activities control the biogeochemical cycles that drive critical ecosystem services but our oceans are
changing rapidly and are under threat from both natural and man made stressors including rising
seawater temperatures ocean acidification over exploitation of resources and increasing impacts from a
growing tourism industry and higher population densities baseline census data concerning the identity
and function of marine microbes provide a benchmark against which we can assess assemblage changes 

australia has the th longest coastline in the world stretching km over the last decade 
sustained temporal observations of many oceanographic parameters around australia’s coastline have
been made possible by the government funded integrated marine observing system imos imos was
established in and operates a network of national reference stations nrs that consist of moored
sensors and regular vessel based sampling for a description of the rationale design and implementation
of imos nrs see http imos org au fileadmin user upload shared anmn nrs rationale and imple 
mentation pdf 

marine microbial ecologists from a number of research institutions and universities have come
together under the umbrella of the australian marine microbial biodiversity initiative ammbi to
facilitate inclusion of microbial monitoring into the imos nrs infrastructure samples are collected at
seven imos nrs port hacking site code phb north stradbroke island nsi maria island mai 
rottnest island rot yongala yon darwin harbour dar and kangaroo island kai fig 

these imos nrs locations span over ° of latitude and have been designed to maximize
representation of the important marine biomes that are present around the continent climatically they
vary from tropical and monsoonal to cool temperate and highly seasonal habitats all sites are affected to
various degrees by basin scale events including the el niño southern oscillation enso and the indian
ocean dipole iod which are known to alter local oceanography such as by enhancing upwelling and
local biology including fisheries furthermore these inter annual events have a large influence on
australia’s two southerly flowing boundary currents the leeuwin current lc on the indian ocean
bounding west coast and the east australia current eac on the pacific ocean bounding east coast 
both these currents transport warm oligotrophic waters from the tropics to temperate latitudes changes
in the extent and timing of southerly flow from these currents are having a large impact on both water
temperatures and species ranges in southern australia influencing fisheries and endangering native
populations however little is known concerning the movements adaption or range expansion of marine
microbes 

methods
microbial sample collection
imos nrs sampling occurs using a variety of ocean going vessels dependent on local conditions at all
nrs water samples are collected from between three and six pre determined depths depending on the
water column depth using niskin bottles on either lines or a rosette for each depth a funnel and dark 
sterile bottle are rinsed with l of the retrieved seawater and the bottle filled in cases where filtration
is conducted on shore within hours of collection bottles are stored in a cooler with ice out of direct
sunlight microbial cells are collected by filtration of l seawater through μm pore sterivex gp filter
 millipore massachusetts cat svgpl rc using a masterflex l s compact peristaltic pump fitted
with an l s channel head cole parmer pump tubing is rinsed with ml seawater from the
appropriate depth prior to cell collection pumping continues for min after sample has cleared the filter
to dry both ends of the filter are capped and placed in individual snap lock bags and kept on ice until
being stored at − °c 

all ammbi samples are collected in conjunction with imos nrs sampling fig so they are
embedded within an extensive quantitative physical chemical and biological oceanographic context 
contextual datasets from nrs are available for public search and download through the imos curated
australian ocean data network portal https portal aodn org au a snapshot of imos data that
corresponds to samples presented in this manuscript is available on figshare data citation 
parameters measured include conductivity temperature density turbidity fluorescence par secchi
depth total alkalinity total dissolved inorganic carbon zooplankton dry weight zooplankton size class 
phytoplankton biomass flow cytometry phytoplankton counts phyto and zooplankton microscopy
identification and counts hplc pigment analysis dissolved oxygen and nutrients including nitrite
 nitrate phosphate silicate and ammonia further in situ moored sensor packages provide high 
resolution data including acoustic doppler current profilers adcp enabling the oceanographic context
at the time of sampling to be accurately described in addition at maria island darwin yongala and
north stradbroke island surface expressions provide real time meteorology including wind speed 
direction barometric pressure humidity air temperature and precipitation

between december and april this the northernmost nrs in the network occupies a broad shallow 
shelf sea region part of the arafura timor sea during the austral winter or “dry season” oceanic waters
predominate and the site is vertically well mixed during the austral summer or ‘wet season” due to
rainfall and terrestrial inputs the water column can become highly stratified across periods from a few
days up to a few weeks the site has a large diurnal tidal movement of up to m and significant amounts
of suspended sediments samples are collected over a h period during sampling days and mid tide
samples used for microbial diversity and associated biogeochemical analyses

dna sequence generation
generation of sequence data for this project is supported by bioplatforms australia bpa all dna
amplification and sequencing is carried out at the ramaciotti centre for genomics unsw sydney 
australia 

bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic assemblages are surveyed using small subunit ribosomal rna gene
amplicon sequencing methods amplicons are prepared using bacterial s rrna gene primers f –
 r refs archaeal s rrna gene primers a f arch f – r refs and eukaryotic 
s rrna gene primers tareuk fwd and tareuk rev ref table we note that the reverse
primer used for the s v region tareuk rev may discriminate against haptophytes a bias which
should be considered when using the data and which has been corrected in primer sets described by
piredda et al 

amplicons are sequenced using the duel indexed paired end approach on the illumina miseq platform
according to the manufactures instructions further documentation outlining the standard operating
procedures for generating and sequencing amplicons is available at https data bioplatforms com 
organization pages bpa marine microbes methods 

dna sequence processing
to allow for the highest possible phylogenetic resolution data are provided as single nucleotide variants 
sequences are analyzed in a strictly standardized fashion alongside other australian microbial
biodiversity initiatives including the biomes of australian soils base project enabling direct
comparison and integration 

for each amplicon each plate of illumina data is submitted to the following workflow separately to
identify correct biological sequences and build sample by read abundance matrices for samples on that
plate 

 illumina r and r reads are merged using flash 
 fasta format sequences are extracted from fastq files and thoseo base pairs bp in length

 oro bp for the s amplicon or containing n s or homopolymer runs of bp are removed
using mothur v 

 using the usearch bit v ref package sequences are de replicated derep fulllength
command ordered by abundance and sequences witho representatives removed sortbysize
command 

 chimeras are removed and biologically correct zero radius operational taxonomic units zotus 
identified unoise command 

 all quality filtered sequences from are then mapped to chimera free zotus and a sample by
read abundance table created using usearch global 

 sample by read abundance matrices from each plate are merged based on the unique zotu sequence 
providing a sample by read abundance matrix for all samples in the dataset 

 a final sample by read abundance data matrix is created by discarding sequences that are either not
identified or not identified correctly for the given assay at the kingdom and phylum level note this
does not remove chloroplasts or mitochondrion from the bacteria assay 

 zotus are taxonomically classified with the silva v ref database using mothur’s
implementation of the wang classifier and a bayesian probability cut off eukaryotic zotus are
also taxonomically classified using the protist ribosomal reference database pr 

 zotus can be readily clustered into otus of any similarity of the researchers choosing for
comparison to other studies using a number of algorithms e g usearch cluster fast

technical validation
ammbi represents to our knowledge the first methodologically standardized continental scale 
temporal microbial ocean observing network we have attempted to minimize biases in the data
generation pipeline by using the same simple sampling protocol at all stations and centralizing each step
of dna extraction csiro sequencing ramaciotti centre for genomics and bioinformatics csiro 
in core facilities that is apart from sampling all steps of the project are carried out concurrently on
samples from all stations the congruence of our phylogenetic characterization of samples with what is
known concerning marine microbial assemblages globally reveals the suitability of our approach 

the alphaproteobacterial family the pelagibacteraceae sar clade compose of the sequences
from surface waters at each station while the sar clade is the most common and abundant
gammaproteobacterial taxa fig a the marine cyanobacteria prochlorococcus and synechococcus
constitute the bulk of the bacterial phototrophic assemblage and vary in their relative abundance with
prochlorococcus relatively more prevalent at stations which display seasonal oligotrophic conditions such
as nsi and yon fig a similarly the euryarchaeota marine groups ii and thaumarchaeota are the
most abundant archaeal taxa fig c 

 s rrna gene relative abundance data provides information concerning heterotrophic symbiotic
and parasitic eukaryotes including metazoa and amoebozoa as well as mixotrophic and phototrophic
taxa including dinophyceae stramenopiles hacrobia cryptomonads and haptophytes and archae 
plastida red and green algae fig the overall diversity revealed within eukaryote taxa is exceptional
 taxa identified analyses of taxa in sub groups fig b–f reveals regional trends in species
abundance and distribution for example several diatom taxa present distinct biogeographical
preferences at individual nrs particularly chaetoceros thalassiosira and leptocylindrus while other
species display a more cosmopolitan distribution e g pseudo nitzschia noctiluca scintillans a
mixotrophic dinoflagellate linked to bright red and bioluminescent coastal blooms is detected at
stations along the east coast mai phb and nsi fig e a number of species associated with harmful
algal blooms are detected within the data alexandrium noctiluca and gymnodinium which highlights
the potential of this initiative to enhance understanding of bloom dynamics within the context of a
holistic record of microbial community structure 

data on phototrophs is further enhanced by specific analysis of plastid s rrna genes that are
retrieved using the bacterial s gene assay fig b plastid s rrna sequences comprise between 
and of total bacterial sequences in surface samples o m depth the plastid s data is highly
complementary with s data and provides a proxy for the relative abundances of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic phototrophs which can be used to fine tune our understanding of regional phytoplankton
provinces for example picoeukaryote species ostreococcus and micromonas contribute a significant
proportion of phytoplankton sequences particularly at mid latitude stations mai kai rot phb 
while cyanobacteria represent a greater proportion of s sequences in low latitude stations dar

usage notes
there is considerable redundancy in the microbial taxa sampled across the seven nrs enabling us to
collect baseline data about the seasonal dynamics of a wide variety of organisms across the breadth of
their habitat range hence the scope of this project enables us to effectively elucidate microbial niche
conditions and describe microbial phenology further the data provide a critical baseline against which
to measure and from which to predict changes in microbial assemblages under future global change
scenarios indeed ammbi data is being used to hindcast abundances of individual microbial taxa to
long term historic oceanographic datasets to infer decadal scale trends in microbial composition and to
