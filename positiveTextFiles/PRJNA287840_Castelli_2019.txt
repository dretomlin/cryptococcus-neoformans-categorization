abstract
symbioses between bacteria and eukaryotes are widespread and may have significant impact on the evolutionary history of
symbiotic partners the order rickettsiales is a lineage of intracellular alphaproteobacteria characterized by an obligate asso 
ciation with a wide range of eukaryotic hosts including several unicellular organisms such as ciliates and amoebas in this work 
we characterized the rickettsiales symbionts associated with two different genotypes of the freshwater ciliate paramecium
caudatum originated from freshwater environments in distant geographical areas phylogenetic analyses based on s rrna
gene showed that the two symbionts are closely related to each other identity belong to the familyrickettsiaceae but are
far related with respect to previously characterized rickettsiales consequently they were assigned to a new species of a novel
genus namely bcandidatus spectririckettsia obscura screening on a database of short reads from s rrna gene amplicon 
based profiling studies confirmed that bacterial sequences related to the new symbiont are preferentially retrieved from freshwater
environments apparently with extremely scarce occurrence positive samples the present work provides new infor 
mation on the still under explored biodiversity of rickettsiales in particular those associated to ciliate host cells

introduction

symbiotic associations are widespread phenomena among liv 
ing beings and actually most eukaryotic organisms represent
holobionts in their natural environment – in this regard 
symbiosis is considered according to the original definition by
anton de bary as bthe living together of unlike organisms 
 simply meaning the even temporary association of or 
ganisms from different species therefore all kinds of rela 
tionships between host and symbionts are included namely
mutualism commensalism and parasitism moreover the ac 
tual borders between those definitions are frequently blurred 
so that the same symbiotic association can shift from mutual 
ism to parasitism and vice versa depending on internal e g 
genotype or life cycle stages or external environmental fac 
tors e g exposure to light or nutrients – 

the endosymbioses between intracellular bacteria and eu 
karyotic hosts are notable because of their natural abundance
and considering the broad taxonomic range and ecological
adaptations of the partners involved – at the same
time some phylogenetic groups of bacteria appear to be

composed only by symbionts of eukaryotes suggesting for
such cases an evolutionary stable adaptation to such lifestyle 
in particular all the currently known members of the mono 
phyletic order rickettsiales alphaproteobacteria as defined
by szokoli and coauthors are obligate intracellular bac 
teria living in association with a wide range of eukaryotes 
rickettsiales were once considered as primarily arthropod 
associated bacteria that can be transferred to humans or to
other vertebrates usually causing pathogenic effects 
 it is now evident that a wide variety approximately two
thirds of known genera of rickettsiales are borne exclusively 
or at least partially by aquatic organisms mostly unicellular
eukaryotes such as amoebae ciliates e g – 
and some photosynthetic species e g – according to
the phylogeny rickettsiales repeatedly shifted host species
along their evolutionary history most likely the ancestral
rickettsiales lived in an aquatic environment and the adapta 
tion to terrestrial hosts apparently occurred several times in 
dependently probably at least six times 

although some rickettsialeswere classified as pathogens or 
more rarely as mutualists in most other cases the relationships
with their hosts were not clarified in detail because in general 
no evident effect on the host biology was observed three fam 
ilies of rickettsiales are now recognized namely rickettsiaceae 
anaplasmataceae and bcandidatus from now on ca 
midichloriaceae well known representatives of
rickettsiaceae are pathogens such as rickettsia prowazekii 
rickettsia rickettsii and orientia tsutsugamushi 
these bacteria are carried by lice ticks and mites and might
cause mild to severe disease such as epidemic typhus rocky
mountain spotted fever and scrub typhus from a phylogenetic
point of view the genus orientia occupies an early divergent
position within the family similarly to the tick endosymbiont
boccidentia massiliensis the ciliate endosymbiont bca 
cryptoprodota formerly cryptoprodotis polytropus 
and bca arcanobacter lacustris the latter bacterium is in 
triguing since it was identified only from a partial genome se 
quence obtained during an environmental screening in a fresh 
water lake thus direct experimental information is not available
either concerning its life cycle or on a potential host the
other members of the family can be divided into three main
clades namely the rickettsia clade the bca trichorickettsia 
clade and the bca megaira clade the rickettsia clade in 
cludes together with pathogens many other bacteria associated
to non hematophagous arthropods as well as endosym 
bionts of leeches and nucleariid amoebae – these non 
pathogenic rickettsia do not show any direct evidence of trans 
mission to vertebrates and their impact on the host were not
fully clarified although a potential role as mutualists or repro 
ductive manipulators was proposed in some cases the
bca trichorickettsia clade is constituted only by two species
of endosymbionts of ciliates i e bca trichorickettsia mobilis 
and bca gigarickettsia flagellata which display in most

investigated host strains a peritrichous flagellation 
although flagella and or flagellar genes were retrieved also in
other representatives of each rickettsiales family 
 – only for the members of bca trichorickettsia clade
a flagellar driven motility was observed the general effects of
bca trichorickettsia and bca gigarickettsia on the host are
still unclear but at least in some specific strains they might
produce parasitic effects under certain conditions 
members of the clade bca megaira are highly diverse in terms
of sequence divergence several species level sub clades identi 
fied and display a broad host range and diffusion indeed its
representatives were found associated to a great variety of aquat 
ic organisms such as hydras corals e g montastraea
faveolata annelid worms micro and macro 
algae such as mesostigma viride volvox carteri carteria
cerasiformis pleodorina japonica and bryopsis sp 
 haplosporidians rhizarians and several cili 
ates including free living diophrys oligothrix euplotes
octocarinatus paramecium caudatum spirostomum minus 
and parasitic ichthyophthirius multifiliis forms 

the knowledge on the diversity of rickettsiales and their
hosts is increasing year by year adding new pieces to the
puzzle of their evolutionary history and ecological adaptations
 many new findings are coming from previously under 
explored locations in particular aquatic environments and or
under explored geographic locations – 

in this work we report the molecular characterization of a
new bacterial species retrieved in association with two differ 
ent genotypes of the ciliate p caudatum collected from geo 
graphically separated locations as distant as brazil and india 
the results of phylogenetic analysis which allowed placing
the symbiont into a novel genus of family rickettsiaceae and
a discussion on its ecological and geographical distribution are
presented 

materials and methods

host strains origin and maintenance

p caudatum pcpb was isolated as monoclonal strain from a
sample collected in the paraibuna river in proximity of the
city of juiz da fora minas gerais brazil in june it was
maintained in laboratory conditions by feeding with a bacte 
rized medium inoculated with raoultella planticola see serra
and coauthors for details dna extraction was per 
formed employing the nucleospin™ plant ii kit macherey 
nagel germany from approximately cells previously
fixed in ethanol 

p caudatum population sh was sampled in araku hills
 andhra pradesh india further details on geographical ori 
gin laboratory maintenance and dna extraction were pre 
sented in a previous study

molecular characterization of hosts and symbionts

all pcr reactions were carried out with takara pcr re 
agents and ex taq takara bio japan using a c ™
thermal cycler bio rad ca usa in case of direct se 
quencing pcr products were cleaned with the eurogold
cycle pure kit euroclone italy and sent to gatc biotech
 germany for sequencing 

the s rrna gene sequence of p caudatum pcpb was
amplified and sequenced with internal primers as previously
described supplementary table 

the s rrna gene sequence of p caudatum sh was
characterized in a previous study 

for the characterization of the bacterial endosymbiont of p 
caudatum pcpb an initial first broad range pcr was per 
formed supplementary table the pcr products were
inserted in pcr® topo® plasmidic vectors invitrogen 
ca usa and the plasmids were transformed to competent
escherichia coli cells mach ® t r invitrogen positive bac 
terial colonies were screened by restriction fragment length
polymorphism rflp i e through digestion with bsuri
 fermentas usa restriction enzyme of a control pcr product
obtained with primers annealing on the cloning vector in the
flanking regions of the insertion site m and t four distinct
restriction patterns were identified and up to two clones for each
pattern were sent to macrogen europe the netherlands for
sequencing using them and t primers in a blastn search
against the ncbi nucleotide database one clone sequence
showed high similarity with members of the obligate intracellu 
lar bacterial order rickettsiales and was therefore putatively
assigned to the symbiont the corresponding s rrna gene
was amplified again for direct sequencing using a new reverse
primer spectririck r designed on purpose
 supplementary table the product was sequenced using a
combination of suitable internal primers and the forward ampli 
fication primer supplementary table 

the s rrna gene sequence of p caudatum sh endo 
symbiont was amplified with a suitable primer pair
 supplementary table the product was cleaned and initially
directly sequenced using bacterial universal primers as previ 
ously described szokoli et al b supplementary table 
since the electropherograms showed double peaks due to the
simultaneous presence of another alphaproteobacterium inside
the same host i e holospora obtusa species specific
primers were designed and used for selective sequencing on
the same pcr product supplementary table 

phylogenetic analyses

the s rrna genes of the hosts and the s rrna genes of
the newly characterized symbionts were aligned with the au 
tomatic aligner of the arb software package version 
on the ssu ref nr silva database 

for the phylogenetic analysis on the hosts other se 
quences of the paramecium genus using the subgenera
chloroparamecium and helianter as outgroup were included
 dataset 

for the analysis on the symbionts other sequences were
selected namely belonging to therickettsiaceae family plus
six additional rickettsiales sequences as outgroup dataset 

after manual editing to optimize base pairing in the pre 
dicted rrna stem regions in each dataset each of the two
alignments was trimmed at both ends to the length of the
shortest sequence resulting respectively in dataset 
and dataset nucleotide columns which were used for
phylogenetic analyses and for building the similarity matrix
 dataset only 

for each phylogenetic dataset the optimal substitution
model was selected with jmodeltest according to
the akaike information criterion aic maximum likelihood
 ml trees were calculated with the phyml software version
 from the arb package performing pseudo 
replicates bayesian inference bi trees were inferred with
mrbayes using three runs each with one cold and
three heated monte carlo markov chains with a burn in of
 iterating for generations convergence was
verified by checking the average standard deviation of the
split frequencies and the potential scale reduction
factor psrf values 

fluorescence in situ hybridization

p caudatum pcpb cells were washed at least three times in
sterile water prior to fixation in formaldehyde in pbs × 
on microscope slides fluorescence in situ hybridization

screening of s rrna gene amplicon data sets

a screening of short sequence reads from the s rrna gene
amplicon based profiling studies available in sra sequence
read archive was performed on the imngs integrated mi 
crobial next generation sequencing platform the endo 
symbionts of p caudatum strain pcpb and population sh 
were queried in parallel on all metagenomic samples available
on imngs built with similarity threshold of and
minimum size of bp the outputs were compared and
otus operational taxonomic units were obtained with

results

host characterization and phylogeny

an almost complete s rrna gene sequence bp was
obtained for the p caudatum strain pcpb mh this
sequence was found to be identical to six other p 
caudatum strains supporting the preliminary species
identification based on morphological features data not shown 
the sequence identity respect to p caudatum sh sequence
 lt was with indel and mismatches 

the reconstructed phylogeny showed that within the
paramecium subgenus the sequence of p caudatum sh 
branched as the sister group of the clade composed of the other
co specific sequences i e p caudatum pcpb and other six
previously published identical sequences ab 
ab af kf he but with a
longer branch suggesting a faster sequence evolution rate
 fig the phylogenetic position of other species within
the paramecium cypriostomum and viridoparamecium sub 
species is consistent with previous studies fig e g 

endosymbiont characterization and phylogeny

the fish screening of p caudatum pcpb cells with the probe
alf b revealed that they harbored alphaproteobacterial sym 
bionts fig a the same host cells resulted negative to the
almost universal bacterial probe eub fig b which tar 
gets over of the sequences of domain bacteria on silva
database the s rrna sequence of the putative endo 
symbiont of p caudatum pcpb obtained by direct sequencing
was bp long the highest retrieved identity was
with the s rrna gene of a bca trichorickettsia mobilis 
 hg supplementary table 

the symbiont s rrna gene sequence obtained from the
sh population was bp long and showed identity
 mismatches no gaps with the pcpb symbiont this value
is well above the commonly accepted species threshold for
bacterial species – indicating that the two
symbionts belong to the same species 

consistent with fish results the sequences of the two
endosymbionts identical in eub probe target region 
showed two consecutive mismatches with respect to this
probe followed by a putative single nucleotide deletion data
not shown unfortunately it was not possible to test in vivo
the targeting of endosymbionts of either host strain with a
species specific probe because the strain pcpb lost the en 
dosymbionts few weeks after the initial fish and dna ex 
traction experiments while the host population sh could be
maintained in laboratory just weeks 

in the phylogenetic analysis the two symbionts clustered
with high support within the family rickettsiaceae fig 
whose characterized members are all obligate intracellular

bacteria consistently with the high sequence identity the two
symbionts formed together a highly supported new clade 
ml bi which we named bca spectririckettsia the
bca spectririckettsia clade formed a monophyletic group to 
gether with the rickettsia bca trichorickettsia and bca 
megaira clades although the precise relationships among
some of these lineages rickettsia plus bca trichorickettsia 
bca megaira and the new clade were not fully resolved the
phylogenetic placement of the other rickettsiaceae namely
bca arcanobacter orientia boccidentia and bca 
cryptoprodota resulted consistent with previous analyses
 namely in earlier divergent positions with respect
to the aforementioned bacteria

endosymbiont environmental screening on imngs
platform

the hits of the screening on imngs were identical for the
endosymbionts of pcpb and sh consistent with the very
high sequence identity of the almost full length s rrna
gene sequences very few hits were found both in terms of
number of samples with sequence hits and in terms of abun 
dance of reads within each sample indeed only out of
 total samples were positive belonging
to bfreshwater metagenome category of total
samples and one to buncultured bacterium category 
of total samples additionally for each sample the
proportion of positive reads was extremely low always less
than of total reads per sample table in terms of
sample provenance most came from british columbia
 canada bioproject prjna while the other
two came respectively from baseline lake michigan us 
 bioproject prjna and from a wastewater aer 
obic bioreactor in daejeon south korea bioproject 
prjdb 

the clustering of sequence hits retrieved a single otu its
centroid sequence showed identity with the sequence
of pbpc symbiont from brazil and with sh sym 
biont from india respectively 

discussion

rickettsiales are a conspicuous lineage of obligate intracellular
bacteria that engage a variegated range of interactions with
many different eukaryotes in particular the family
rickettsiaceae is really notable for the numerous clades includ 
ed and the variety of hosts in the present study we report the
characterization of two rickettsiaceae bacteria associated to
different strains of the ciliate protist p caudatum from geo 
graphically distant locations namely brazil and india 

our analyses reconstructed phylogenetic relationships
within the family rickettsiaceae confirming the general

results from previous studies indeed the rickettsia clade 
mainly constituted by arthropod associated bacteria includ 
ing arthropod vector borne pathogens was recovered with
high support and consistently as the sister group of the mono 
phyletic bca trichorickettsia clade formed only by endo 
symbionts of ciliates the monophyly of bca 
megaira clade which includes several endosymbionts of cil 
iates was also recovered as well as the mono 
phyly of the novel bca spectririckettsia clade ml 
bi consistent with the high sequence identity 
supplementary table this new clade appeared phyloge 
netically associated with high support ml bi with
rickettsia bca trichorickettsia and bca megaira clades

all together however the precise phylogenetic relationship
between bca spectririckettsia and those three lineages still
remains unclear this can be tentatively linked to a putative
high evolutionary rate shown by bca spectririckettsia 
which in turn can be inferred on the basis of the extremely
long branch sustaining them and in line with the high se 
quence divergence with respect to the other rickettsiaceae
 ≥ supplementary table further analyses with en 
larged taxonomic sets and or employing additional sequence
markers may help in elucidating this point we can foresee
that in the next future such analyses will take profit from even
more taxonomically enlarged datasets considering that in re

the chance to perform microscopical analyses on the two

for what concerns the strain pcpb initial fish experiments
confirmed the presence of alphaproteobacterial rod shaped en

became negative to all tested fish probes data not shown 
this result can be attributed to an apparent instability of the

symbiotic association possibly due to changes in the physiolog 
ical state with respect to the natural environment after a
prolonged permanence under laboratory conditions 
nevertheless several coherent data led to the conclusion that
the characterized sequence indeed derived from the observed
endosymbiotic bacteria in detail the endosymbiotic bacteria

the alphaproteobacterial fish probe but were negative for the

symbionts of eukaryotic organisms interestingly also the appar 
ent rarity of sequences related to these symbionts retrieved in
 s rrna amplicon based profiling studies is consistent with
an obligate intracellular lifestyle therefore we propose the new
genus and species name bca spectririckettsia obscura be 
cause it is phylogenetically related to rickettsia and its morpho 
logical features and relation with the host were not fully
disclosed remaining partially obscure 

the finding of two closely related new symbionts in p 
caudatum strains originating from very distant places clearly
indicates that this kind of interactions are more widely spread
than expected furthermore considering that they both oc 
curred in tropical regions this could be interpreted as a

distinctive ecological trait of this symbiont at the same time 
it should be considered that all the closely related sequence hits
retrieved from imngs screening originated from temperate
locations table these data might suggest a wider geograph 
ical distribution in any case given the overall paucity of se 
quences affiliated to bca spectririckettsia including imngs
hits and the present study further records would be necessary
to evaluate the effective distribution of this symbiont and
whether it has some climatic preference or responds to seasonal
fluctuations at present only a few studies treated the distribu 
tion of endosymbionts of ciliates – nevertheless with
the increasing number of retrievals the biogeography and sea 
sonality of such interactions might become useful information

in the study of such symbioses despite the two hosts being
conspecific it seems highly unlikely that the symbionts could
have been vertically inherited because no other p caudatum
strain especially referring to those in the same clade of pcpb 
resulted positive for bca spectririckettsia infection fig 
even though they have been carefully screened in the past for
the presence of endosymbionts e g intriguingly the
alternative scenario could suggest a preference of bca 
spectririckettsia towards p caudatum as target host in hori 
zontal transmission although only further analyses might con 
firm this aspect 

the presence of coexisting symbionts in the same ciliate host
strain is another relevant feature as for p caudatum from india
 sh the occurrence of another endosymbiont i e holospora
obtusa was documented in detail interestingly 
rickettsiales as well as the phylogenetically related
holosporales appear somehow inclined and flexible in
cohabiting together with other bacteria inside ciliate cell com 
partments for example in one strain of freshwater euplotes
aediculatus from india four bacterial endosymbionts namely
bca trichorickettsia mobilis the bca midichloriaceae bac 
terium bca cyrtobacter zanobii the betaproteobacterium
polynucleobacter necessarius and the gammaproteobacterium
bca nebulibacter formerly nebulobacter yamunensis were
detected in a stable association – another example is
a strain of euplotes woodruffi from brazil hosting two cohab 
iting symbionts namely the bca midichloriaceae bacterium
bca bandiella woodruffii and polynucleobacter necessarius
 among those symbionts polynucleobacter necessarius
 betaproteobacteria burkholderiales is notable since it is
known to be a necessary endosymbiont for survival of several
euplotes species bca bandiella woodruffii on the other
side has been detected so far only once nevertheless 
phylogenetically close microorganisms were found in associa 
tion with other ciliates euglenoids and metazoans from fresh 
water and marine environments therefore covering a wide
range of hosts interestingly the same
pair of bacterial endosymbionts namely the two holosporales
preeria caryophila andcaedimonas varicaedens was found in
two strains of paramecium biaurelia sampled independently in
italy and germany in general the ecological role of
bacterial endosymbiont communities of ciliates is still far from
being understood although these associations appear more
common than previously thought in addition the dynamics
between these coexisting prokaryotic endosymbionts are not
completely explained although it was hypothesized that p 
necessarius might play a crucial role in facilitating the estab 
lishment of a secondary symbiosis in the same ciliate host 
and the role of holospora and holospora like bacteria as vec 
tors for the entrance of other symbionts was repeatedly sug 
gested in different studies – perhaps even some
rickettsiales symbionts could play a similar role as carriers
for other bacteria 

our results constitute another little piece of progress in the
study of rickettsiales and of bacterial symbionts of ciliates 
reinforcing the evidences on the broad diversity within this
order of alphaproteobacteria and underpinning how much
more should be done to undercover this still hidden treasure
of bacterial biodiversity
