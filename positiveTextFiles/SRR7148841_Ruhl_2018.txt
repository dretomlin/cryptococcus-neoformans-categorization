summary

microbial species diversity may peak at certain opti 
mal environmental conditions and decrease toward
more extreme conditions indeed bell shaped rela 
tionships of species diversity against ph and temper 
ature have been demonstrated but diversity patterns
across other environmental conditions are less well
reported in this study we investigated the impact of
salinity on the diversity of microorganisms from all
three domains in a large set of natural springs with
salinities ranging from freshwater to halite saturated 
habitat salinity was found to be linearly and inversely
related to diversity of all three domains the relation 
ship was strongest in the bacteria where salinity
explained up to of the variation in different diver 
sity metrics otus shannon index and phylogenetic
diversity however the relationship was weaker for
eukarya and archaea the known salt in strategist
archaea of the halobacteriaceae even showed the
opposite trend with increasing diversity at higher
salinity we propose that high energetic requirements
constrain species diversity at high salinity but that
the diversity of taxa with energetically less expensive
osmotolerance strategies is less affected declining
diversity with increasing osmotic stress may be a
general rule for microbes as well as plants and ani 
mals but the strength of this relationship varies
greatly across microbial taxa 

introduction

as early as the s ecologists began to document
how environmental parameters affect species diversity of
plant and animal communities humboldt 
although microbial community compositions are clearly
also affected by particular environmental parameters it is
poorly understood how these environmental parameters
affect overall species diversity recent studies have dem 
onstrated strong correlations of microbial alpha diversity
 local species diversity to ph fierer and jackson 
lauber et al and temperature sharp et al 
zhou et al both relationships are bell shaped 
with a maximum diversity at a midpoint value and a
decreasing diversity towards extreme conditions one
theory to explain these relationships is the physiological
tolerance hypothesis currie et al which pro 
poses that species richness varies inversely with ener 
getic stress since tolerating stress requires an
expenditure in energy hallsworth it follows that in
high stress environments fewer species are able to gen 
erate enough energy to support stress tolerance and
damage repair metabolisms sufficiently to grow and
reproduce this places strong constraints on which spe 
cies can survive 

salinity may be an even stronger driver of bacterial
community composition than temperature and ph
 lozupone and knight yang et al to toler 
ate high environmental salinities and keep their cyto 
plasm iso osmotic with the environment organisms
use one of the following two strategies the salt in and
the salt out strategy oren the archaeal family
halobacteriaceae and some members of bacterial phyla
firmicutes and bacteroidetes are salt in strategists
 oren b these organisms accumulate molar con 
centrations of potassium chloride oren most
bacteria non halobacteriaceae archaea and all haloto 
lerant eukarya use the salt out strategy they either syn 
thesize or import large quantities of compatible organic
solutes oren b both the salt in and salt out strate 
gies require energy although the salt out strategy is par 
ticularly costly as it usually involves the synthesis of high 
energy organic molecules oren because salt 
tolerance is an energetically expensive process the

physiological tolerance hypothesis predicts that species
diversity would be inversely correlated with environmental
salinity similarly it follows that this correlation would be
strongest for salt out strategists because they expend
more energy on salinity tolerance than salt in strategists
 oren oren noted that some metabolic
pathways like nitrification and methanotrophy have never
been observed above certain salinities and suggested
that these metabolic processes simply do not provide suf 
ficient energy for cell maintenance above certain salinity
limits 
increasing habitat salinity has been shown to correlate

to decreasing plant and animal diversity anderson et al 
 atrill lercari and defeo watson and
byrne however only a few studies have investi 
gated the effect of salinity on microbial alpha diversity 
with conflicting results either no correlation casamayor
et al joint et al wang et al or
mixed results depending on the diversity index used
 benlloch et al dillon et al campbell and
kirchman the most convincing study to date
used illumina sequencing of s rrna genes to demon 
strate significantly declining diversity with salinity yang
et al based on a sample set of nine lakes 
in this study we investigated the diversity of all three

domains bacteria archaea and microbial eukarya in
samples covering a wide salinity range we selected a
 km study region within wood buffalo national park
in northern alberta which contains relatively stable
saline to hypersaline spring systems grasby 
ranging in salinity from to g l− nacl microbial
communities were sampled from sites across these
springs and analysed via s rrna or s rrna gene
sequencing

beta diversity of bacteria versus salinity

a weighted unifrac nonmetric multidimensional scaling
 nmds plot showed samples clustering by conductivity
 fig indicating that salinity exerted a strong influence
on community structures 

the samples were sorted by conductivity and com 
bined into five equal groups of samples each the
total metadiversity of these groups showed a decreasing
trend versus salinity supporting information fig s 
that is more total species were detected in low salinity
than in high salinity samples to further illustrate the dif 
ference in bacterial communities living at the extremes of
the salinity spectrum we compared the otus detected in
the highest and lowest salinity groups fig most of
the otus detected were unique to one group or the
other 

relative abundance of proteobacteria actinobacteria 
cyanobacteria and verrucomicrobia did not correlate with
conductivity bacteriodetes and firmicutes increased in rel 
ative abundance with increasing conductivity supporting
information fig s while chloroflexi planctomycetes and
acidobacteria declined 

combined these beta diversity analyses indicate that
 i the bacterial species detected in low salinity and high 
salinity sediments were mostly distinct and ii fewer spe 
cies were adapted to survive in high salinity environ 
ments this suggests that the diversity versus salinity
relationship figs and is primarily driven by species
that are evolved to thrive in the respective environments
and is not an artefact of community assembly or preser 
vation of inactive species in certain conditions it is possi 
ble that more species dispersed from the surrounding
 low salinity forest ecosystems are preserved in the low 
salinity sediments than in the high salinity sediments 
however while this might explain a difference in total
species richness it would not explain the trend in the
shannon and simpson indices which are weighted
against rare species and account more for abundant
 growing species dispersal and preservation would also
be less likely to explain the trend in the anoxic subsur 
face environments supporting information appendix s 

alpha diversity of archaea versus salinity

for archaea the shannon index and the number of
observed species did not show statistically significant
relationships to conductivity fig a and b the phylo 
genetic diversity index fig c did however have a
statistically significant inverse relationship with
conductivity 

salt in versus salt out strategists

we hypothesized that diversity salinity relationships
would depend on the osmotolerance strategies used 
alpha diversity analyses were therefore run on two sepa 
rate archaeal otu tables i one containing all of the
known archaeal salt in strategists members of the family
halobacteriaceae represented by of the total

otus representing archaeal salt out strategists it must
be noted that as yet unidentified archaeal salt in strate 
gists would not have been removed from this otu table 
alpha diversity of the halobacteriaceae significantly
increased with increasing salinity fig d–f non 
halobacteriaceae archaea the salt out strategists how 
ever exhibited a statistically significant decline in alpha
diversity with increasing conductivity with a high r of

we also selected only otus associated with known salt

halanaerobiales accounting for otus of the 
total otus in the s rrna dataset generated using
bacteria specific primers another known bacterial salt in
species salinibacter ruber was not detected in our data 
set despite the low number of otus rarefaction curves for
the shannon and simpson diversity indices showed satura 
tion supporting information fig s b no significant rela 
tionships were observed in the diversity metrics of this
group versus salinity supporting information fig s a 

alpha diversity of microbial eukarya versus salinity

diversity–conductivity relationships were also negative in
the eukarya but the relationships were weaker than
observed for the bacteria supporting information
fig s for example the r values for the shannon
index versus salinity were lower in eukarya vs 
in bacteria and slopes were shallower − vs
− some phyla such as the archaeplastida 
representing the green and red algae even exhibited an
increasing relative abundance with increasing conductiv

information fig s the trends were weaker for
archaea and eukarya the archaea communities
detected included a large number of salt in strategists a
strategy that allows them to survive high salinity at a low
metabolic cost when presumed salt out strategists
 those that use compatible solutes for osmoregulation 
among the archaea oren b were considered
alone the alpha diversity relationship with conductivity
was similar to that seen in the bacteria supporting infor 
mation fig s a–c conversely known salt in strategists
among both the bacteria and the archaea showed no
significant decline in diversity or even showed an
increase in diversity with increasing conductivity

 supporting information fig s a and fig d–f we
recognize the obvious caveat that osmotic tolerance
strategies of uncultured species cannot be known with
certainty however the analyses were focused primarily
on taxa that are well known salt in strategists such as
the halobacteriaceae and halanaerobiales and a few
exceptions are unlikely to greatly affect these large
datasets 

these data are consistent with the hypothesis that when
organisms are forced to invest more energy in stress toler 
ance mechanisms less energy is available for reproduction
and thus only the most energetically favourable lifestyles
can provide enough energy to both cope with stress and

salinity versus microbial diversity 



reproduce oren a this limitation in the number of
viable metabolic strategies in turn means that fewer taxa
are adapted to live in hypersaline conditions other factors 
such as the availability of habitat could also influence
diversity–salinity relationships however a stress based
effect is supported by i the detection of a lower metadiver 
sity fewer total otus in all of the highest salinity samples
compared to the lowest salinity samples fig ii the lack
of correlation between conductivity and alpha diversity of
microorganisms that have evolved the energetically less
expensive salt in strategy supporting information fig s a
and fig a–c iii the weaker relationship in eukarya 
which use a compatible solute that is less energy intensive
to produce than solutes used by bacteria see below 
 iv the increasing strength of the relationship when consid 
ering phylogenetic diversity as the metric compared to rich 
ness or shannon index and v the increasing strength of
the relationship when considering diversity at higher taxo 
nomic levels such as the phylum or class level rather than
the otu level the last two points indicate that a
much broader phylogenetic range of microbes are found in
the low salinity environments suggesting that those
adapted to the highest salinity environments are limited to
fewer phyla and classes together these observations
show that high salinity environments are able to support
fewer and less phylogenetically diverse bacterial taxa this
is likely due to the high energetic demand of salinity toler 
ance interestingly the only bacterial phyla that showed an
increasing relative abundance with increasing conductivity 
firmicutes and bacteroidetes supporting information
fig s are the only two bacterial phyla known to contain
salt in strategists oren b 
many of the bacteria present are likely to import solutes

in addition to synthesizing them de novo this is energet 
ically less expensive than synthesizing all solutes how 
ever apparently this strategy is not prevalent enough to
eliminate the observed diversity trends free solutes are
probably in limited supply and subject to high
competition 
only a weak correlation between species diversity

and salinity was detected for the microbial eukaryotes 
we suggest two separate explanations for this trend 
first eukaryotes primarily use glycerol as an osmotic
solute oren stevenson et al a and sec 
ond most of the eukaryotes present are oxygenic
phototrophs glycerol is among the least energetically
expensive solutes to synthesize requiring only atp
per molecule synthesis of the most commonly used
prokaryotic osmotic solutes glycine betaine and
ectoine requires atp oren thus by using
glycerol eukaryotes are able to expend comparatively
less energy on salinity tolerance and grow at the high 
est salinities ever reported stevenson et al b a
different explanation is that oxygenic photosynthesis is

common among halotolerant eukaryotes which is a
lifestyle likely to provide excess energy for solute pro 
duction oren a indeed a large proportion of the
eukaryotic read set was represented by green algae 
especially at higher salinities supporting information
fig s in support of this possibility bacterial photo 
trophs in the cyanobacteria also did not exhibit a
reduction in alpha diversity with increasing salinity r 

value data not shown together these observa 
tions lend further support to the hypothesis that diver 
sity decline at high salinity is primarily caused by
energetic limitations 

the relationship between salinity and alpha diversity is
effectively linear in our sample set with highest diversity
in the lowest salinity samples diversity declines but still
stays well above at salt saturation this relationship is
very different than relationships observed between diver 
sity and temperature or ph where a peak diversity value
at some midpoint tails off to wards at the extremes
 fierer and jackson lauber et al sharp
et al zhou et al temperature and ph are
linear gradients in which both extremes represent stress 
ful conditions and the minimum and maximum limits of
life are well contained within the entire range salinity in
contrast imposes a stress on life only at the upper range
and even at nacl saturation water activity remains well
above the limit for life lee et al therefore the
nature of its effect on species diversity is fundamentally
different 

other studies have addressed this potential relation 
ship benlloch et al joint et al casamayor
et al wang et al campbell and kirchman 
 dillon et al with mixed results the study of
yang and colleagues was the first to use the next 
generation sequencing to find a strong negative relation 
ship between bacterial alpha diversity and salinity in a
set of hypersaline lakes our study supports this finding
with a dataset that is more extensive and more well 
balanced across the full range of salinity furthermore 
by investigating effects of salinity on all three domains of
life we propose that the alpha diversity trend is due to
energetic limitation at high stress levels 

currently our understanding of biogeography is
largely dominated by studies on macroorganisms 
plants and animals understanding the biogeography of
microorganisms is necessary for a complete theory of
biogeography of all living organisms furthermore 
understanding diversity in nacl rich environments has
implications for the habitability of other halite rich water
systems in or solar system one potential example
being the ocean of europa hand and carlson 
here we have shown that microbial diversity declines
with increasing osmotic stress in the same way as the
diversity of larger organisms does however the

study site and sample collection

a total of unique sediment samples were collected
from saline spring systems from wood buffalo
national park in northern alberta in september 
the springs were clustered in an area of km geo 
graphic coordinates of all sites are found in supporting
information table s several systems contained multiple
individual spring sources and outflow areas that either
mixed with fresh water or showed increasing salinity due
to evaporation hence the large variability in conductivity
seen in sample sets from some locations supporting
information table s 

springs in this area are fed by meteoric and glacial
waters that may pass through halite deposits grasby 
 a sediment chemistry analysis performed in 
 grasby showed that all springs had a thalassoha

ture readings in were consistent with readings
taken in grasby ranging from to �c
with an average of �c ph values of samples were
very similar varying by less than u all springs
were shallow with sediment laying no more than cm
below the water surface some springs had a single dis 
tinct source pool these tended to have consistent con 
ductivities regardless of where the sediment was
sampled other areas showed seepage into several shal 
low pools spread over a wider area up to m in
these cases conductivities tended to vary from one pool
to another probably depending on relative rates of flow
versus evaporation several samples were therefore
taken from such seep sites
