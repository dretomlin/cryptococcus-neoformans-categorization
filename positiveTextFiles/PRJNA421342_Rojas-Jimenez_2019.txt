salinity is a significant factor for structuring microbial communities but little is known for
aquatic fungi particularly in the pelagic zone of brackish ecosystems in this study we
explored the diversity and composition of fungal communities following a progressive
salinity decline from to psu along three transects of ca km in the baltic
sea the world’s largest estuary based on s rrna gene sequence analysis we
detected clear changes in fungal community composition along the salinity gradient
and found significant differences in composition of fungal communities established
above and below a critical value of psu at salinities below this threshold fungal
communities resembled those from freshwater environments with a greater abundance
of chytridiomycota particularly of the orders rhizophydiales lobulomycetales and
gromochytriales at salinities above psu communities were more similar to those
from marine environments and depending on the season were dominated by a strain
of the lkm group cryptomycota or by members of ascomycota and basidiomycota 
our results highlight salinity as an important environmental driver also for pelagic fungi 
and thus should be taken into account to better understand fungal diversity and
ecological function in the aquatic realm

introduction

in recent years there has been a growing interest in studying fungi in the aquatic environment 
mainly due to their significant roles in the cycling of nutrients and elements such as carbon
 wurzbacher et al grossart and rojas jimenez the increased use of next generation
sequencing approaches provides a detailed insight into biodiversity and occurrence of aquatic fungi
 wurzbacher and grossart most studies coincide in pointing out a large number of fungal
taxa to be described nikolcheva et al tedersoo et al wurzbacher et al richards
et al grossart et al yet the understanding of other aspects related to their metabolic
functions and ecology remains to be investigated richards et al frenken et al 

among factors modulating fungal diversity and community composition in aquatic ecosystems 
salinity is of vital importance for example a clear differentiation between fungal populations in
freshwater estuarine and marine environments has been observed booth and kenkel geib
et al mohamed and martiny bálint et al de vargas et al jeffries et al 
 zhang et al marine environments are generally characterized by a low proportion of

fungi with respect to the overall number of eukaryotes
 richards et al in relation to the composition
of fungal communities in marine environments some studies
indicate that they are dominated by fungi belonging to the
phylum chytridiomycota while other studies indicate that fungi
belonging to dikarya could be the most abundant hassett et al 
 picard rämä et al wang et al in
freshwater ecosystems there is usually a higher proportion of
fungi belonging to chytridiomycota comeau et al maier
and peterson wurzbacher et al arroyo et al 

previous studies have shown that the majority of organisms
are adapted to freshwater or marine conditions while there
are organisms like aspergillus flavus that are ubiquitous and
can inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments zuluaga 
montero et al ramírez camejo et al also there
are few brackish species with a wide tolerance to salinity
 logares et al telesh and khlebovich for example 
herlemann et al showed that there are associations of
brackish marine and limnic bacteria in the baltic although their
diversity was not affected and thus not significantly lower at
brackish conditions despite this the knowledge about fungal
communities in brackish ecosystems and variations in their
composition at different salinity levels is limited first because
studies addressing these issues are rare hu et al kettner
et al secondly because most research has been conducted
in estuaries with variable salinity conditions and short residence
times that do not select for populations adapted to constant
brackish conditions along a more permanent and extended
salinity gradient as can be found in the baltic sea 

the baltic sea constitutes an ideal model system to study
autochthonous communities of brackish water fungi since it
is one of the largest brackish ecosystems in the world with a
progressive salinity decline over a distance of approx km
from psu in the kattegat in the southwest denmark–
sweden to psu in the bothnian bay in the northeast sweden–
finland figure since the narrow and shallow danish straits
constitute a barrier for the exchange with more saline waters
from the open north sea the baltic sea has relatively stable
horizontal and vertical salinity gradients minimal tidal effects 
and long retention times of up to years kautsky and kautsky 
 reissmann et al we provide new insights into
the occurrence and diversity of aquatic fungi along the salinity
gradient in the baltic sea and identify a threshold value at which
fungal communities noticeably diverge 

materials and methods

we used illumina sequencing of the s rrna gene to
characterize the fungal community composition in the baltic sea 
across three transects of ca km each and to determine the
effect of salinity on structuring community composition along
gradients ranging from to psu figure for this we
used two datasets of sequences dataset comprises samples
of surface waters collected during three cruises in summer
 june th – july th winter february rd –
march th and spring may st – june th dataset is

composed of samples collected at surface and intermediate
layers – m vs – m from nine stations during the spring
 cruise at each sampling point of every cruise water was
collected using a conductivity temperature depth device ctd 
sea bird scientific bellevue wa united states connected to
polyethylene canisters concentrations of dissolved inorganic

analyzed as described by grasshoff et al particulate

results and discussion

in this work we analyzed the diversity and composition of
fungal communities along the baltic sea salinity gradient 
using two different datasets of sequences of the s rrna
gene the percentage of eukaryotic sequences belonging to the
fungal clade was for dataset surface water sampled
in summer winter and spring and 

for dataset water sampled at different depths only in spring
 however we observed marked variations in the relative
proportion of fungi between sampling stations table and
supplementary figure s within the otus identified
in dataset the two most abundant comprised of the
fungal sequences and were identified as lkm cryptomycota 
and rhizophydiales chytridiomycota within the otus
identified in dataset the two most abundant comprised 
and were identified as paramicrosporidium cryptomycota and
rhizophydiales supplementary table s 

we observed pronounced changes in the composition of the
fungal communities along the baltic salinity gradient figure 
which was consistent at different phylogenetic levels we also

figure non metric multidimensional scaling analyses of the fungal
communities in the baltic sea the analysis was made from samples of the
two datasets used in this study dataset comprising samples determined
for surface waters collected during three cruises in summer winter
 and spring and dataset comprising samples collected at
nine stations during spring considering two depth horizons and fl vs 
pa fractions a analysis by season b analysis by salinity group 

in mesohaline waters chytrids assigned mainly to orders
rhyzophydiales and lobulomycetales were more common 
while a strain of paramicrosporidium was more abundant at
oligohaline conditions figure in this dataset we did
not find significant differences between fl and pa fractions
 supplementary table s 

changes in fungal community composition above vs 
below the salinity threshold were also significant in dataset
 permanova p in this dataset we further
determined significant differences in community composition
between the three studied seasons permanova p 
figure a in summer the sites with higher salinities
showed a greater abundance of ascomycota particularly
of the genera cladosporium and saccharomyces while
the mesohaline sites were dominated by chytridiomycota
belonging to the orders rhizophydiales and gromochytriales 
in winter the pattern was more variable although
a greater abundance of leotiomycetes ascomycota 
and cystobasidiomycetes basidiomycota was observed
at salinities above psu below this threshold taxa
belonging to the chytrid orders rhizophydiales and
lobulomycetales were more abundant except at station b 
 bothnian gulf where geotrichum ascomycota was more
frequent figure 

although not yet shown for fungal communities the
notion of a specific salinity threshold driving variations in
organismic community composition is not entirely new 
for example telesh and khlebovich proposed a
critical range of – psu for zooplankton communities in
the baltic sea while herlemann et al also observed
that bacterial communities formed different clusters above
and below a salinity of psu in addition previous studies
on aquatic fungi have shown differences along very broad
salinity gradients e g between estuarine coastal and oceanic
samples jeffries et al stream pond melting ice and
estuary samples in the arctic zhang et al between
the freshwater mixolimnion and brackish monimolimnion in
antarctic lakes rojas jimenez et al salty brackish 
and freshwater marshes mohamed and martiny 
intertidal wetlands and shallow marine sediments picard 
 and a coastal environment with variable riverine inputs
 taylor and cunliffe 

despite the overall changes in the eukaryotic community
composition between seasons we show that a specific salinity
threshold is related to variations in the composition of pelagic
fungal communities particularly in a system with a high
residence time such as the baltic sea this is consistent
with earlier studies e g shearer et al showed
that taxonomic occurrence and species distribution were
mainly determined by temperature and salinity while
tisthammer et al showed that global biogeography
of marine fungi is shaped by local environmental variables 
including salinity we found some significant effects
of other environmental variables such as sio total
n o and po on the structure of the communities 
however these effects occurred in a rather inconsistent
way being present in one or the other data sets analyzed
 supplementary table s thus for a better mechanistic
understanding we consider that it is important to investigating
the effects of salinity and other environmental variables
on the structure of aquatic fungal communities in a
higher spatio temporal resolution this is of particular
importance in transition zones such as between the north

sea and the baltic sea where changes in these variables
are quite abrupt 

the specific causes of the observed greater or lower tolerance
to salinity of specific fungal phylotypes remain to be elucidated 
however there are three possible physiological mechanisms
that can intervene the first is related to the increase in
the concentration of ions within the cells through the use
of high affinity transport systems that allow to carrying i e 
potassium ions inward and then confine them in vacuoles 
this mechanism allows tolerant fungi to maintain an osmotic
potential lower than the external water potential the second
mechanism is related to the osmoregulatory capacity which is 
to adjust the accumulation of specific solutes called osmolytes
or osmoprotectants through endogenous production or by
uptake from the medium the glycerol is one of the main
osmoprotectant in fungi is harmless for the structure and
function of cytoplasmic proteins and also alleviates some
inhibitory effects of high ionic strength the two previous
mechanisms are present in both yeasts and filamentous fungi
 jennings blomberg and adler logares et al 
the third mechanism is related to a mechanical strengthening
of the cell and is present mainly in filamentous fungi where
for example increases in the thickness of cell walls have been
observed with increases in salinity ahumada rudolph et al 
 on the other hand it is well known that chytrids prefer
aquatic environments with low osmotic potentials probably
because their zoospores lack a cell wall which make them
more susceptible to osmotic stress gleason et al gleason
and lilje however some chytrids have been reported
as parasites of small green algae and diatoms in marine
waters suggesting that even these organisms may be using
other mechanisms to cope with salinity gleason et al 
hassett et al 

it is also possible that the range of distribution of some
fungal groups particularly those that contain phytoplankton
parasites such as rhizophydiales lobulomycetales and
gromochytriales frenken et al are affected by the
distribution of their respective hosts this would be consistent
with studies showing the darss sill with salinities between 
and psu as the border for some phytoplankton species
 lemke et al witkowski et al wasmund
et al celepli et al conversely members of
basidiomycota and ascomycota such as unicellular yeasts 
can be more tolerant to higher levels of salinity as observed
during summer and winter at stations with salinities psu
 kutty and philip 

in this study we estimated that the average richness per
sample comprises fungal otus range – in dataset and
 otus range – in dataset supplementary figure s 
within dataset we did not find any significant differences in
richness values season of the year nor between communities at
salinities above and below psu kruskal–wallis p 
we also did not observe significant differences in fungal richness
of dataset when considering variables such as salinity depth 
or between the pa and fl fungal fractions similar patterns of
the shannon index were visible with mean values of and
 for datasets and respectively again no significant

differences were found with any of the environmental variables
analyzed from these results we conclude that salinity has a
clear effect on fungal community composition in the baltic
sea which is not necessarily reflected in changes of the species
richness and diversity 

based on the obtained taxonomic identification and related
ecological information we were able to recognize members of
ascomycota basidiomycota and zygomycota as saprotrophs 
we speculate that these fungi participate in the recycling of
nutrients and biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds or can
act as biotrophs of cyanobacteria algae oomycetes protozoa 
and microinvertebrates kutty and philip leshem et al 
 other members of chytridiomycota particularly those
assigned to rhyzophydiales and lobulomycetales might act as
parasites frenken et al they can infect unpalatable
silicon covered diatoms and release energy rich zoospores that
can be readily utilized by fungal predators kagami et al 
 additionally some of these parasitic fungi
have the potential to inflict mass mortalities on hosts because
changes in phytoplankton size and suppress bloom events 
like those occurring in spring or late summer see review
frenken et al however we request to further examine
the functional and ecological roles of fungi in the baltic
sea using cultivation based methods to uncover their different
metabolic potential 

conclusion

our work confirms that salinity holds an important role
in structuring pelagic fungal communities of the baltic
sea in particular we determined a significant variation
in fungal species composition and community structure
above and below a threshold of psu this finding has
important implications since the presence of different fungal
groups with changing salinity levels potentially influence
aquatic food web structure and ecosystem functions in
the future it will be necessary to analyze a greater number
of sampling points along the gradient also considering a
higher temporal resolution which would allow a better
understanding of the fluctuations of fungal populations
in time and space likewise we consider it important to
study in greater detail the main physiological mechanisms of
adaptation to salinity that operates in the different phylogenetic
groups of fungi
