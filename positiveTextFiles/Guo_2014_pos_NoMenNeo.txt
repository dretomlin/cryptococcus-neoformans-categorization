the eruption of mount oyama on the island of miyake miyake jima created a unique opportunity to study the early 
ecosystem development on newly exposed terrestrial substrates in this study bacterial and fungal communities on and 
 year old volcanic deposits at poorly to fully vegetation recovered sites in miyake jima japan were characterized by con 
ventional culture based methods and pyrosequencing of s rrna and s rrna genes despite the differences in the vege 
tation cover the upper volcanic deposit layer samples displayed low among site variation for chemical properties ph total 
organic carbon and total nitrogen and microbial population densities total direct count and culturable count statistical 
analyses of pyrosequencing data revealed that the microbial communities of volcanic deposit samples were phylogenetically 
diverse in spite of very low carbon environmental conditions and their diversity was comparable to that in the lower soil layer 
 buried soil samples comparing with the microbial communities in buried soil the volcanic deposit communities were 
characterized by the presence of betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria as the main bacterial class deinococcus 
thermus as the minor bacterial phyla and ascomycota as the major fungal phyla multivariate analysis revealed that several 
bacterial families and fungal classes correlated positively or negatively with plant species 

key words volcanic deposits early microbial community s rrna gene s rrna gene pyrosequencing plant microbe interaction

a number of studies have shown that microorganisms were 
the primary colonizers on newly exposed volcanic substrates 
such as lava tephra and volcanic ash and contributed to early 
ecosystem development on such new substrates 
 prior to colonization by plants the pioneer microbes 
were found to play a significant role in the fixation of carbon 
and nitrogen from the atmosphere resulting in the input of 
organic matter into the deposit – 
subsequent colonization of plants directly influences the 
deposit microbial community through litter input root exu 
dates and dead root tissues reciprocally specific 
microbes can associate with plants through root microbe 
symbiosis or have a negative effect on plants by microbial 
interfering actions such plant microbe interactions 
will drive primary ecosystem succession on the volcanic 
deposit recently glacier forefront ecosystems were well 
characterized as a model of primary microbial succession on 
newly exposed substrates concerning volca 
nic environments information on such interactions is limited 
but several studies on a volcanic desert and young volcanic 
deposits showed that the soil microbial biomass and 
community structure were influenced by colonizer plants 
 

the island of miyake miyake jima is a volcanic island 
situated on the western rim of the pacific ocean ° ’ n 

 ° ’ e supplemental material fig s in mt 
oyama on the island erupted ejecting large amounts of 
volcanic ash and forming a collapsed crater about of 
vegetation on the island was initially influenced by the heavy 
deposition of volcanic ash after crater formation large 
amounts of volcanic gas containing so and h s were 
emitted and caused widespread defoliation particularly 
on the leeward side of mt oyama vegetation 
has been gradually recovering from this damage in the 
foothills of the mountain and on the windward sides north 
and northeastern but not on the leeward sides eastern and 
southwestern due to volcanic gas we have investigated 
early bacterial communities on the volcanic ash deposit at a 
completely unvegetated site near the crater and showed that 
the microbial community was dominated by autotrophic 
n fixing fe ii oxidizers acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and 
the leptospirillum groups by clone library analysis of s 
rrna genes 

the aim of this study was to characterize the microbial 
community of the miyake jima volcanic deposit on a wind 
ward side where vegetation recovered gradually and to 
analyze how the early microbial community responds to 
the first colonizer plants in this study we established three 
sites along an elevational transect representing sparsely 
grass covered site ig fully grass and partially shrub 
covered site ig and fully grass and shrub covered land 
 site ig the investigation was designed to compare 
bacterial and fungal communities among these deposits by

the volcanic deposit in and the soil layer buried soil 
beneath the volcanic deposit were sampled on july and 
september after removing the surface litter layer upper 
volcanic ash deposits were taken from – mm in depth at site 
ig – mm in depth at site ig and – mm in depth at 
site ig avoiding mixing of the root rich layer the buried soil 
to cm underneath the volcanic deposit layer was also taken from 
each site at sampling several core samples were taken from each 
layer up to a total of about kg mixed in sterile plastic bags and 
immediately stored on ice finally samples were divided into two 
portions and kept at °c and − °c until bacteriological analysis 
and dna extraction respectively major roots and plant debris were 
removed from all samples prior to analysis and extraction 

chemical analysis
total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were 

determined using a shimadzu toc analyzer toc l shimadzu 
kyoto japan and a yanaco chn corder type mt yanaco 
analytical instruments kyoto japan respectively slurry consisting 
of a mass ratio of sample and deionized water was used to 
determine the ph value the volumetric water content was analyzed 
by drying the material at °c overnight 

respiratory activity and substrate utilization profile
to measure in vitro respiratory activity as co evolution g 

volcanic deposit sample or g buried soil sample were placed 
together with a portable wireless infrared co monitor c d 
w tr or c d w tr udom mito japan in a sealed 
ml volume plastic box carbon dioxide concentration in the box 
was recorded continuously at – °c for min and initial co 
production rate was calculated the assay was performed within 
several hours after sampling eco microplate biolog hayward 
ca usa was used for organic substrate utilization profiling 
as described previously in brief g sample was suspended 
in ml sterile water and then the suspensions were shaken 
on a reciprocal shaker at strokes min− for min after 
centrifugation at ×g for min µl subsamples were 
inoculated into each well of the plate triplicate 

enumeration methods and soil ergosterol quantification
total direct microscopic counts tdc of bacteria were 

determined using ethidium bromide with fluorogenic dye as 
described previously in brief triplicate membrane filters were 
prepared and bacteria were counted in at least randomly selected 
microscopic fields of each filter preparation culturable bacteria 
were enumerated on full strength nutrient broth nb and 
diluted nutrient broth dnb as the plating agar medium four 

replicates of sample dilutions were plated and incubated at °c for 
 days fungal propagules were counted on rose bengal agar 
medium in four replicates ergosterol was determined as an 
indicator of fungal biomass by the method of vibration assisted 
extraction followed by hplc quantification the hplc 
system tosoh tokyo japan was essentially the same as described 
previously a soil sample taken at a forest site unaffected by the 
 eruption on miyake jima and two agricultural soils from the 
field science center ibaraki university college of agriculture 
were used as references 

dna extraction pcr amplification and tag pyrosequencing
five grams of the volcanic deposit samples were used for 

dna extraction according to a method based on lysis with a high 
salt extraction buffer m nacl and extended heating of 
the sample suspension in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate 
hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide and proteinase k 
dna extraction from the buried soil samples – g was 
performed by isoil for bead beating nippon gene tokyo japan 
with skim milk powder wako osaka japan according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications dna 
extraction was made in duplicate and the extracts were pooled all 
pooled dna samples were purified using ampure xp magnetic 
purification beads beckman coulter brea ca usa the v v 
region in the s ribosomal rna gene was amplified using uni 
versal primers fmod and r under thermal conditions of

for min and a final extension of °c for min on a pcr 
system life technologies japan tokyo japan according to the 
protocol of kim et al another universal primer set f r 
was used to analyze the fungal community where the same 
pyrosequencing adaptors and barcode sequences for amplification of 
 s rrna gene were used the f r primer set has been 
shown to target a region of the fungal s ribosomal rna gene 
which is variable between major taxa and can permit phylogenetic 
analyses such as unifrac for the primer sequences see the 
supplemental material pcr was performed in the same condition 
with pcr amplification of s rrna gene described above except 
that the annealing tem perature was set to °c pcr products of s 
rrna gene and s rrna gene were confirmed by electrophoresis 
on agarose gels purified by beckman ampure xp magnetic 
purification beads and quantified using the quant it picogreen 
dsdna assay kit life technologies a composite sample was 
prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of pcr ampli 
cons from each sample and subjected to pyrosequencing using the 
 gs flx titanium or gs junior roche applied science 
penzberg germany according to the manufacturer’s instructions 

sequence data processing and analysis
all the raw sequence data obtained from pyrosequencing 

were assigned to each sample on the basis of their barcode sequence 
reads with an average quality value and not having both uni 
versal primer sequences were filtered off the selected reads were 
denoised using the ‘pre cluster’ command in mothur pcr 
chimeras were filtered off using chimera slayer to remove the 
small portions of unexpected archaeal sequences the sequences of 
 s rrna genes were identified by the rdp classifier and the 
archaeal sequences filtered out further to remove the portions of 
unexpected non fungal sequences the effective sequences of s 
rrna gene were aligned with the silva small subunit ribosomal 
rna ssu rrna database by the basic local alignment search tool 
 blast the non fungal sequences were filtered out after 
the above operation the sequences of each sample were defined as 
qualified reads and each data set was rarefied to the smallest libraries 
using daisy chopper available at http www genomics ceh ac uk 
geneswytch to define operational taxonomic units otus 
pairwise distances between sequences of the trimmed data sets 
were calculated as the average neighbor algorithm here otus 
were defined at an average intra otu sequence identity of 



guo et al 

which is the narrowest clustering distance recommended for 
pyrosequences good’s coverage abundance based coverage 
estimator ace shannon wiener index h’ and the inverse 
simpson index d were calculated at the cutoff level 
pairwise dissimilarities between samples were calculated by the 
weighted unifrac metric based on a relaxed neighbor joining tree 
that was built with the representative sequence for each otu using 
the ‘clearcut’ command the silva bacterial and eukaryotic 
trees provided by mothur available at http www mothur org wiki 
silva reference files were used for the reference trees of unifrac 
analyses for classification the sequences were compared to the 
silva ssu rrna database using the bayesian classifier and a 
confidence threshold of bootstrap 

statistical analysis
multivariate analysis of variance manova was used to test 

for significant differences in the chemical and biological properties 
of samples and tukey’s honestly significant difference hsd test 
was performed to determine the rank order significance was defined 
at p the influence of the sampling site sample type and time 
factor on the microbial diversity indices otus abundance based 
coverage estimator shannon index and inverse simpson index was 
also evaluated using student’s t test and manova at cutoff 
with confidence intervals on the r platform available at http 
www r project org similarities and differences in bacterial and 
fungal community structure among the samples were examined 
using the weighted unifrac distance with the principal coordinate 
analysis pcoa ordination technique heat maps of the most 
abundant bacterial otus and fungal otus in each sample 
were used to compare the major compositions of the libraries the 
heat maps were constructed using the function heatmap from the r 
package gplots available at http cran r project org web packages 
gplots index html for better visualization of heat maps otus 
tables were log transformed hierarchical clustering of rows 
and columns in the heat maps was based on bray curtis similarities

microbial population densities
microbial cell densities of the volcanic deposit samples 

ranged from about × cell g− dry soil for ig vd

about one order of magnitude lower than levels in the buried 
soil samples table similarly plate counts on dnb were

plate counts on nb table the plate counts on dnb were 
 to times higher than those on nb for all the tested 
samples except for the ig vd sample giving times 
higher counts on dnb than on nb the difference between 
plate counts on dnb and nb can be explained partly by the 
presence of oligotrophic bacteria the ergosterol content 
was undetectable µg g− dry soil for all the tested 
volcanic deposit and buried soil samples because the refer 
ence soils from the forest in miyake jima and the arable land 
contained and µg g dry soil − the results indicated 
that the fungal populations in both the volcanic deposits and 
buried soils were far lower than those in normal environmen 
tal soils for the samples taken in the fungal propagule

deposit samples and to g dry soil − for the buried soil

volcanic deposit 
the most abundant bacterial otus in each sample were 

selected otus for all samples and their abundances 
were compared to those in other samples as shown in a heat 
map fig a heat map cluster analysis showed two distinct 
clusters which confirmed the difference between the bacte 
rial communities of volcanic deposits and buried soils fig 
 a this cluster analysis showed among site variation of 
the bacterial community in the volcanic deposits by forming 
two separate clusters of site ig ig vd and ig vd 
and ig ig vd and ig vd samples and sepa 
rating them from site ig samples ig vd and 
ig vd on the other hand the buried soil bacterial 
communities from the same sampling date but not the same 
site clustered together consistent with the results of pcoa 
analysis fig a 

likewise the most abundant fungal otus in each 
sample were selected otus for all samples and 
their heat map comparison is illustrated in fig b overall 
the results of heat map cluster analysis confirmed the three 
major clusters given by pcoa analysis site ig volcanic 
deposit samples site ig and ig volcanic deposit 
samples and buried soil samples from all sites 

phylogenetic analysis of bacterial communities
high percentages of bacterial otus to 

from the volcanic deposit samples could be assigned to 
known bacterial phyla while the percentages of assignable 
otus from the buried soil samples were lower to 
 major bacterial phyla that represented of 
each community composition were acidobacteria actino 
bacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes 
and proteobacteria fig a proteobacteria was the most 
abundant phylum in the volcanic deposit bacterial communi 
ties to and constituted the major group in the 
buried soil communities to relative abundance 
estimations of the underlying classes revealed differences 
between the volcanic deposit and the buried soil communi 
ties although alphaproteobacteria was predominant in the 
communities of both the volcanic deposit and buried soil 
samples fig b betaproteobacteria dominated by the 

family oxalobacteraceae and gammaproteobacteria domi 
nated by the family xanthomonadaceae represented the 
main classes in the volcanic deposit communities but quite 
minor classes ≤ in the buried soil communities 
 fig c and d except for the ig vd community 
the families oxalobacteraceae and xanthomonadaceae 
increased their relative abundance in response to changes in 
vegetation cover from grass site ig to shrub site ig 
plants in contrast the ig vd sample harbored a higher 
proportion of alphaproteobacteria and lower proportions of 
betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria than the other 
samples 

further classification at the family level of the phylum 
actinobacteria indicated that the family acidothermaceae 
was exclusively present in all buried soil samples but not in 
all volcanic deposit samples fig e an inspection of 
minor bacterial populations also indicated a difference 
between the volcanic deposit and buried soil bacterial com 
munities fig f deinococcus thermus accounted for 
 – of the total otu number of each volcanic deposit 
community but of the buried soil communities 
except for ig vd in addition the relative abundance of 
cyanobacteria was higher in the volcanic deposit samples 
 – than in the buried soil samples – 

phylogenetic analysis of fungal communities
ascomycota was the most abundant phylum in the fungal 

communities of both volcanic deposit – of total 
otus in each sample and buried soil – samples 
followed by basidiomycota and glomeromycota fig g 
it was noteworthy that the class sordariomycetes in 
ascomycota was the most abundant in site ig volcanic 
deposits ig vd and ig vd but low in site ig 
and ig volcanic deposits fig h as for basidiomycota 
agaricomycetes was the main class in the volcanic deposit 
especially in the ig vd community and buried soil 
communities fig i

statistically significant environmental factors including 

fig principal coordinate analysis pcoa plots of bacterial a and fungal b communities of the volcanic deposit triangles and diamonds 
and soil circles and squares samples by weighted unifrac silva bacterial and eukaryotic trees were selected as the reference trees

early microbiota on volcanic deposits 

 

discussion

a number of studies have indicated that the early 
development of the microbial community on recent volcanic 
deposits and deglaciated soils 
was associated with pioneer colonizer plants in a study of a 
volcanic desert on mount fuji total carbon tc tn and 
soil organic matter som contents increased with vegetation 
development and soil microbial biomass was strongly 
correlated with tc tn and som contents these 
findings suggested that the belowground accumulation of 
organic nutrients along with vegetation development was a 
determinant of soil microbial biomass at our study sites 
sites ig and ig were covered fully with grass plants and 

partly or mostly with shrub plants in spite of vegetation 
development the toc values of all volcanic deposit samples 
 – g kg− in table were much lower than those of the 
samples in the above mentioned studies – g kg− for 
a subalpine volcanic desert on mount fuji – g 
kg− for a glacier forefield from the data of the 
 and year old volcanogenous regosols on miyake 
jima a positive linear relationship was noted between 
volcanic deposit age and tc which is approximated by an 
equation tc g kg− t r where t is volcanic 
deposit age y the toc values – g kg− of our 
volcanic deposit samples age – y total inorganic carbon 
undetectable levels substantially fit the equation from the 
equation it will take y to accumulate tc g kg− in

the volcanic deposit therefore our study reveals the earliest 
change in the belowground microbial community at the onset 
of vegetation cover development 

although the volcanic deposit samples contained approx 
 times lower toc than the buried soil samples differ 
ences in microbial population density were not as large as the 
differences in toc values table this can be explained 
partly by differences in the content of available organic mat 
ter when the in vitro respiratory activity of all samples is 
plotted against the corresponding toc values the respiration 
per unit of organic carbon decreased sharply at higher toc 
values fig suggesting a relative reduction in available 
substrate in the samples this organic matter dynamics was 
noted previously by a study of to year old hawaiian 
volcanic deposits interestingly a recent study of degla 
ciated soils showed that soil carbon along the chronosequence 
was of microbial origin and inputs of organic matter were 
dominated by microbial carbon and nitrogen fixation 
generally microbial biomass is characterized by a low c n 
ratio and biomass debris is readily consumable for soil 
microbes which can result in high activity of respiration per 
unit of organic carbon indeed the c n ratio was much lower 
in the volcanic deposit samples to than the buried 
soil samples to table 

various preceding studies on volcanic deposits deglaciated 
soils and other newly exposed minerals have shown that 
the phylum proteobacteria usually dominates the early 
bacterial community because the bacteria in 
this phylum have advantageous traits such as phototrophy 
photoheterotrophy and chemolithotrophy in early eco 
systems with limited nutrient resources our results showed 
that although the vegetation developed at different levels 
proteobacteria was still the most abundant phylum in the 
bacterial community of volcanic deposits inspection of 
the underlying families revealed the predominance of the 
family oxalobacteraceae in betaproteobacteria and 
xanthomonadaceae in gammaproteobacteria in the vol 
canic deposit communities fig c and d the family 
oxalobacteraceae was reported as root colonizing hetero 
trophic bacteria in a succession of bacterial communities 
during early plant development this can be expected 
to be true for the bacterial community of the miyake jima 
volcanic deposit because cca showed a positive correlation 

of oxalobacteraceae with a grass carex oshimensis fig 
 a the family xanthomonadaceae was reported as a major 
component of pasture rather than woodland or broad leaved 
forest in our data the correlation of xanthomonadaceae 
with carex oshimensis also seemed to be positive in the 
cca plot fig a in the ig vd samples oxalo 
bacteraceae and xanthomonadaceae were replaced by 
alphaproteobacteria specifically the families aceto 
bacteraceae bradyrhizobiaceae and xanthobacteraceae 
 fig b to d this succession seems to be supported by 
the notion that plants raised the proportion of alpha 
proteobacteria particularly rhizobiales in various soil 
environments 

actinobacteria are the second most abundant phylum 
dominating the bacterial community in volcanic deposits 
 fig a and e which are generally known to decompose 
recalcitrant polymers in soils a recent study of 
zimmerman sand created by glacial outwash indicated that 
host plant species and increasing plant richness altered the 
composition of streptomyces communities which were the 
most abundant among the actinobacteria similar to this 
finding in our study the family level composition of 
actinobacteria in the volcanic deposits was also found to 
differ distinctly at different sites fig e on the other 
hand actinobacteria composition in the buried soil samples 
was essentially invariant among the sites as discussed 
above the respiration per unit of soil organic carbon seems 
to reflect the nature of soil organic matter and thus the very 
low respiration rates of the miyake jima buried soil samples 
suggest the presence of higher amounts of recalcitrant sub 
strates than those of readily consumable substrates in the soil 
samples this may explain the steady population density of 
actinobacteria in the buried soil 

the phylum acidobacteria is ubiquitous and abundant in 
various soil environments but the proportion of this 
group is relatively low in early bacterial communities 
 in the case of miyake jima volcanic deposits the 
proportion of acidobacteria increased from to 
with vegetation development fig a but was still lower 
than the average level in various soils it has been 
reported that the abundance and composition of acidobacteria 
in soils seemed to be strongly regulated by the soil ph value 
 as mentioned above the volcanic deposit samples 
displayed low among sample variation for the ph to 
 and thus the environmental ph is not likely to be the 
determinative factor for the distribution of acidobacteria 
in miyake jima volcanic deposits 

our results showed that the phylum cyanobacteria was 
present at low levels – of bacterial communities in 
the miyake jima volcanic deposits fig f this organism is 
known to be the primary colonizer of newly exposed minerals 
and dominates early microbial communities in 
addition to this phototroph the filamentous anoxygenic 
phototrophic chloroflexi was found to be present at higher 
levels about in the site ig volcanic deposit than 
cyanobacteria fig a although the population was low in 
site ig and ig deposits the chloroflexi group may occupy 
a wider niche than cyanobacteria in unvegetated sites it 
is also noted that deinococcus thermus was found in ig 
volcanic deposits but not in soil samples fig f the genus 

fig relationship between toc and respiration per unit amount of 
organic carbon toc 



early microbiota on volcanic deposits 

deinococcus is known to show marked resistance to a range 
of damage caused by ionizing radiation desiccation uv 
radiation and oxidizing agents resistance to solar 
radiation or desiccation may be a secondary determinative 
factor for the survival of microbes in volcanic deposits 
particularly at unvegetated sites 

no detectable amount of ergosterol and low counts of 
fungal propagules in the miyake jima volcanic deposit and 
buried soil samples table indicated that fungi constituted 
low fractions of their microbial communities from the 
contents of ergosterol in upland soils about to µg 
ergosterol g dry soil − the fungal population density 
of the miyake jima samples is estimated to be less than 
one tenth of those in the upland soils it has been reported 
that fungi are more influenced by vegetation type than 
prokaryotes because fungi are directly associated with plants 
 in spite of the low fungal populations a substantial 
number of fungal reads were obtained from the volcanic 
deposit samples the results of pcoa showed high among 
site variation for the fungal communities in the volcanic 
deposits fig b further the cca plot showed ascomycota 
thriving in the site ig volcanic deposit for example the 
class sordariomycetes showed a highly negative relationship 
with the major plants miscanthus condensatus and alnus 
sieboldiana fig b interestingly zumsteg et al reported 
a similar observation the succession from an ascomycota 
dominated community in unvegetated soils to a more 
basidiomycota dominated community in vegetated soils in 
the forefield of the damma glacier members of 
sordariomycetes are ubiquitous and represent pathogens and 
endophytes of plants animal pathogens and mycoparasites 
 however information on the sordariomycetes in 
unvegetated volcanic deposits is not yet available within 
basidiomycota the class agaricomycetes was exclusively 
present in the ig vd sample fig i members of 
agaricomycetes are the most important ectomycorrhizal 
fungi which construct symbiotic associations with many 
territorial plants further investigations at the glacier 
forefield showed that plant colonization could increase 
the proportion of mycorrhizal fungi in the early soil 
communities of alpine habitats analogously in our 
results agaricomycetes showed a positive correlation with a 
shrub rubus trifidus fig b to examine further these 
fungus plant correlations community analyses should focus 
on the rhizosphere of colonizer plants 

in conclusion this study showed that microbial com 
munities in recent miyake jima volcanic deposits were 
phylogenetically diverse despite low carbon conditions 
because the volcanic deposit samples displayed low among 
site variation for chemical properties ph toc and tn 
there is no apparent factor other than the aboveground 
vegetation cover to explain the difference in microbial com 
munity among the different site volcanic deposits indeed 
cca could show several positive and negative relationships 
between microbial groups and plant species our findings 
give a better understanding of how belowground microbial 
communities develop and interact with the establishment of 
the first aboveground plants in newly exposed volcanic 
deposits
