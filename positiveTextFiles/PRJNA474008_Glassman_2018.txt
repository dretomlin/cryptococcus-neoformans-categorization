abstract recent discussion focuses on the best method for delineating microbial
taxa based on either exact sequence variants esvs or traditional operational taxo 
nomic units otus of marker gene sequences we sought to test if the binning ap 
proach esvs versus otus affected the ecological conclusions of a large field
study the data set included sequences targeting all bacteria s rrna and fungi
 internal transcribed spacer its across multiple environments diverging markedly
in abiotic conditions over three collection times despite quantitative differences in
microbial richness we found that all � and � diversity metrics were highly positively
correlated r � between samples analyzed with both approaches moreover 
the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches 
consequently statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable furthermore esvs
only moderately increased the genetic resolution of fungal and bacterial diversity
 and times otu richness respectively we conclude that for broadscale e g 
all bacteria or all fungi � and � diversity analyses esv or otu methods will often
reveal similar ecological results thus while there are good reasons to employ esvs 
we need not question the validity of results based on otus 

importance microbial ecologists have made exceptional improvements in our un 
derstanding of microbiomes in the last decade due to breakthroughs in sequencing
technologies these advances have wide ranging implications for fields ranging from
agriculture to human health due to limitations in databases the majority of micro 
bial ecology studies use a binning approach to approximate taxonomy based on
dna sequence similarity there remains extensive debate on the best way to bin
and approximate this taxonomy here we examine two popular approaches using a
large field based data set examining both bacteria and fungi and conclude that
there are not major differences in the ecological outcomes thus it appears that
standard microbial community analyses are not overly sensitive to the particulars of
binning approaches

characterization of microbial communities by amplicon sequencing introduces bi ases and errors at every step hence choices concerning all aspects of molecular
processing from dna extraction method to sequencing platform are debated 
further downstream the choices for computational processing of amplicon sequences
are similarly deliberated e g see references to yet despite these ongoing debates 
microbial ecology has made great strides toward characterizing and testing hypotheses
in environmental and host associated microbiomes e g see references and 

within microbiome studies operational taxonomic units otus have been used to
delineate microbial taxa as the majority of microbial diversity remains unrepresented

in global databases while any degree of sequence similarity could be used to
denote individual taxa a sequence similarity cutoff became standard within
microbial community analyses this cutoff attempted to balance previous standards for
defining microbial species and recognition of spurious diversity accumulated
through pcr and sequencing errors 

recently it has been suggested that taxa should be defined based on exact
nucleotide sequences of marker genes delineation of taxa by exact sequence variants
 esvs also termed amplicon sequence variants asvs or zero radius otus zotus
 is not only expected to increase taxonomic resolution but could also simplify
comparisons across studies by eliminating the need for rebinning taxa when data sets
are merged due to these advantages there has been a surge in bioinformatic pipelines
that seek to utilize esvs and minimize specious sequence diversity – moreover 
some proponents have stated that esvs should replace otus altogether however 
as with the adoption of any new approach there remains a need to quantify how this
new method compares to a large body of previous research furthermore otu
classifications remain biologically useful for comparing diversity across large data sets
 or identifying clades that share traits 

here we tested if use of esvs versus otus affected the ecological conclusions 
including treatment effects and � and � diversity patterns from a large field study of
leaf litter communities this study included a “site” and “inoculum” treatment in which
all microbial communities were reciprocally transplanted into all five sites see
text s in the supplemental material along an elevation gradient we sequenced
both bacteria s rrna and fungi internal transcribed spacer its from litterbags
collected at three time points and months after deployment in separate
sequencing runs while we expected that the binning approach would alter observed
richness we hypothesized that it might not alter trends in � and � diversity but that
these results might differ based on the amplicon sequenced 

in total we analyzed � million bacterial and � million fungal sequences using
uparse v see table s in the supplemental material which allowed for a direct
comparison of esv versus otu approaches by keeping all other aspects of quality
filtering and merging consistent we selected a direct comparison with otus
as it is the most standard threshold and the clustering algorithms appear to be most
effective at this level r edgar personal communication a recent study also found that
clustering thresholds from to yield highly stable results 

esv and otu � diversity was strongly correlated across samples using four metrics
for both bacteria and fungi mean pearson’s r � � all p values are � 
for three metrics berger parker shannon and simpson the esv and otu approaches
were not only highly correlated mean pearson’s r � � but nearly equivalent
in their values mean slope � see table s in the supplemental material for
observed richness esv versus otu was also highly correlated across all time points 
sequencing runs pearson’s r � fig a and b however bacterial otu richness
was approximately half of esv richness for the same sample mean slope � and
fungal otu richness was approximately three quarters of esv richness mean slope �
 we speculate that this difference between bacteria and fungi is due to the coarser
phylogenetic breadth of the s versus its genetic regions 

� diversity metrics were also strongly correlated across samples for esvs and otus
 bray curtis average mantel’s r � for bacteria and for fungi all p values are
� fig c and d whether assessed by abundance based bray curtis or
presence absence jaccard metrics table s moreover the values of the � diversity
metrics were nearly identical regardless of binning approach slopes of 

the highly correlated � and � diversity metrics indicated that results based on these
metrics should yield similar ecological conclusions indeed the patterns of bacterial and
fungal richness and community composition across the elevation gradient were nearly
indistinguishable fig see fig s in the supplemental material as were the statistical
tests for both richness see table s in the supplemental material and community
composition see tables s and s in the supplemental material moreover family and

genus level compositions at each site along the gradient were virtually identical for
bacteria see fig s in the supplemental material and highly similar for fungi see
fig s in the supplemental material with no taxa being over or underrepresented in
the esv versus otu approaches for bacteria fig s c and only one for fungi fig s c 
we also included a mock community of eight distinct bacterial species in our pcr and
sequencing runs both approaches resulted in highly similar mock community compo 
sition see fig s in the supplemental material thus we found no evidence that esvs
yield better taxonomic resolution or are more sensitive to detecting treatment effects
 if anything the esv method appeared to be slightly less sensitive to detecting
treatment effects on richness than the otu method especially for fungi in which fewer
significant treatment effects were detected using esvs table s 

despite quantitative differences in microbial richness ecological interpretation of
our large bacterial and fungal community data set was robust to the use of esvs versus
 otus thus even though there are good reasons to take an esv approach we
need not question the validity of ecological results based on otus indeed while
previous studies have found that esvs can help explain additional variation among
samples the � and � diversity patterns of esvs and otus in these studies were
also quite similar in general we suspect that the robustness of such comparisons will
vary depending on the breadth of the microbial community targeted for instance here
we characterized all bacteria and fungi in a diverse environmental community as
opposed to a narrower subset of taxa or a less diverse host associated community

 months c and d comparison of observed � diversity for c bacteria and d fungi as assayed by the

finally both otus and esvs mask ecologically important trait variation of
individual taxa in our study esvs only slightly increased the detection of fungal
and bacterial diversity and times otu richness respectively highlighting that
ribosomal marker genes at any resolution are generally poor targets for improving
genetic resolution within a microbial community for example it is widely known that
many taxa can share the same s rrna or its thus if strain identification is
critical then a full genome or amplicon of a less conservative marker gene is
required however for broadscale community � and � diversity patterns although the
vagaries of molecular and bioinformatics processing inevitably add noise to microbial
sequencing data strong community level signals will likely emerge with suitable study
designs and statistics regardless of binning approach
