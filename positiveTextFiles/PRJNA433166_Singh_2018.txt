abstract

background pseudogymnoascus destructans pd the causative fungal agent of white nose syndrome wns has
led to the deaths of millions of hibernating bats in the united states of america usa and canada efficient strategies
are needed to decontaminate pd from the bat hibernacula to interrupt the disease transmission cycle without affecting
the native microbes previously we discovered a novel trichoderma polysporum tp strain wpm which inhibited
the growth of pd in autoclaved soil samples in the present investigation we used culture based approaches to determine
tp induced killing of native and enriched pd in the natural soil of two bat hibernacula we also assessed the impact of tp
treatment on native microbial communities by metagenomics 

results our results demonstrated that tp at the concentration of conidia g soil caused killing of native pd in
culture within weeks of incubation a fold higher concentration of tp conidia g soil killed an enriched pd
population conidia g soil the fungal operational taxonomic units otus dominated by ascomycota and
basidiomycota and bacterial otus dominated by acidobacteria and proteobacteria comprised the native soil
microbes of the two bat hibernacula no significant differences in fungal and bacterial relative abundances were observed
between untreated and tp treated soil tp conidia g soil p≤ 

conclusions our results suggest that tp induced killing of pd is highly specific with minimal to no impact on the
indigenous microbes present in the soil samples these findings provide the scientific rationale for the field trials of tp
in the wns affected hibernacula for the effective decontamination of pd and the control of wns

background
pseudogymnoascus destructans pd the etiological agent
of white nose syndrome wns has caused significant
reductions in hibernating bat populations across the
usa and canada – mortality was first observed in
hibernating bats in howes cave near albany new york
 ny in and has since spread extensively to us
states and canadian provinces recently pd was

detected in a little brown bat myotis lucifugus as far
away as washington state several species of bats are
already threatened with extinction including myotis
lucifugus little brown bat myotis sodalis indiana bat 
and myotis septentrionalis northern long eared bat 
 pseudogymnoascus destructans a psychrophilic fungus 
is well adapted to grow in the cold conditions prevailing
in caves and mines it has been shown to secrete
proteolytic enzymes similar to the fungi that cause skin
infections dermatophytes and has a clonal popula 
tion in the usa – low body temperature along
with reduced immune system in hibernating bats provides
the optimal growth environment for pd –

alarmingly pd has been found to survive in the affected
hibernacula even in the absence of bats – thus an
infected hibernaculum could remain contaminated with
pd for prolonged periods of time and serve as the foci for
new infections mathematical models have predicted
that reducing pd in caves and mines may prevent wns 
associated bat mortality currently efforts are be 
ing devoted to the development and testing of chemical
and biological agents for the effective eradication of pd
from bat hibernacula and hibernating bats although these
control strategies appear to be promising they are not
being used for the large scale decontamination of hiber 
nacula because of the likely off target effects on the native
microbial communities – considering the mass
mortality of bats caused by wns and the economic loss
of billion dollars to agricultural pest control in the
usa annually imminent steps are needed to decon 
taminate pd from bat hibernacula and break its transmis 
sion cycle 
previously we characterized a novel psychrotolerant

trichoderma polysporum tp strain wpm from
the william preserve mine ulster county ny one of
the mines at the epicenter of the wns zoonotic tp
grew well at low temperatures of – °c and inhibited
pd in laboratory media and autoclaved soil samples 
the present study aimed at further evaluation of tp as
an effective biocontrol agent against pd specifically we
examined a if tp could act as an effective biocontrol
agent against pd in the natural soil from bat hibernacula
and b whether tp treatment impacted the native micro 
bial communities in the natural soil from bat hibernacula 

methods
fungal strains and media
pseudogymnoascus destructans pd strain m and
tp strain wpm were used as described previously
 all fungal isolates were maintained on sabour 
aud dextrose agar sda slants at °c and stored in
 glycerol at − °c in sterile cryogenic vials sabour 
aud dextrose agar fortified with an enhanced panel of
antibacterials sda a additional file sda a with
cycloheximide g l and rose bengal agar with chlor 
amphenicol rbc μg ml were used for the isolation
of pd tp and other fungi from bat hibernacula as
described previously potato dextrose agar pda 
and water agar wa were used to induce spore forma 
tion in pd and tp millet seeds extract was used to for 
tify nutrients in the soil samples from bat hibernacula for
tp and pd interaction studies in brief g of millet seeds
was added in ml water was autoclaved at °c for
 min and was mixed with an additional ml steril 
ized water the resulting extract was passed through mus 
lin cloth autoclaved as above allowed to cool and stored

at °c until used all the experiments were performed in
the biosafety cabinet in a biosafety level laboratory 

biocontrol application of tp in natural soil
to determine tp induced killing of pd in a natural soil 
one soil sample from aeolus cave ac bennington
county vt dark black in color collection date of 
 and one soil sample from barton hill mine bhm 
essex county ny course sediments collection date of
 were used soil samples approximately
 g from each site were weighed transferred to an
autoclaved mortar and pestle and mixed gently to obtain
a homogeneous mixture the mixture was aliquoted into
eight vials for each site with each vial containing g of
soil four vials were inoculated with pd conidia g
soil and the remaining four vials received sterilized
water following week post incubation two of the four
pd containing vials received tp conidia g soil to ob 
tain a ratio of pd to tp the other two pd containing
vials received sterilized water pd only of the remaining
four vials in which pd was not inoculated two received
tp conidia g soil which served as tp only controls 
while the remaining two vials received sterilized water and
served as soil only controls additional file all the vials
were incubated at °c for weeks 
to determine the number of tp required for killing

pd in subsequent experiments fold conidia g
soil and fold conidia g soil higher concentra 
tions of tp conidia than pd conidia conidia g soil 
were added and these soil samples were incubated at °

 additional file 

culture recovery of pd tp and other fungi
following incubation of soil samples at °c for – weeks 
 mg of soil sample was removed from each vial in dupli 
cate and transferred into ml screw cap vials the soil
sample was suspended in μl of sterilized water and vor 
texed vigorously ten fold dilutions of the supernatant were
prepared and μl of each dilution was plated onto various
media plates mm diameter in duplicate the plates
were incubated at °c and checked periodically for the re 
covery of pd tp and other fungi as described previously
 in brief sda a medium was used to determine the
tp colony forming units cfus sda a with cyclohexi 
mide was used to determine pd cfu and the rbc medium
was used for the determination of other fungi present in
the cave and mine soil samples the percent killing of pd
by tp was calculated using a formula − pd cfu experi

communities at the phylum and genus levels
for fungi of all sequences could be assigned at the
phylum level with seven phyla identified from ac and
five phyla identified from bhm both ac and bhm
were dominated by otus from ascomycota and basid

discussion
we demonstrated that the biocontrol agent tp inhibited
pd in the presence of microbes that are native to the soil
from the affected hibernacula this finding further ex 
panded our earlier observations of the efficacy of tp in
killing of pd in autoclaved soil samples another
important finding of this study was the specificity of tp
for killing pd with minimal to no impact on the micro 
bial diversity and community structures of soil samples
tested from both ac and bhm even though the micro 
bial community compositions of ac and bhm were
significantly different they were not affected by tp treat 
ment suggesting that the soil communities are relatively
robust and indifferent to tp treatment the combined
culture based and metagenomics approaches allowed us
to follow the fate of the biocontrol agent and its target
in the treated soil culture based monitoring of pd and
tp was important to estimate loss of viable organisms
while dna based approaches provided better census of
microbial communities 
several dna and culture based studies have revealed

wide distribution and persistence of pd in bat hibernac 
ula other published cave fungal surveys
indicate that pd could survive and persist in bat hiber 
nacula for prolonged periods and can have impact on
both wns disease management and epidemiology

to eradicate pd from bat hibernacula we need highly
competent biocontrol agent which can grow sustain 
and selectively kill pd without impacting the hibernacula
ecosystem the tp strain used in this investigation ful 
fills all these criteria thereby strengthening the argu 
ment for application of tp as a potential biocontrol
agent against pd in caves and mines 
in concordance with metagenomics analysis the

dual culture challenge studies of tp with several fungi
recovered from ac and bhm revealed that except for
one isolate of microascus species the growth of other
fungi was not affected by tp microascus is a soil sapro 
phyte and a common agent of bio deterioration 
since other species in the genus microascus were not
inhibited by tp we do not anticipate deleterious effects
on cave mine ecosystem conversely tp grew well in
the presence of both fast and slow growing fungi as
well as in the presence of other microbial communities
indigenous to the soil samples tested the high survival
potential of tp in hibernacula soil suggests its ability to
survive under unfavorable conditions and high repro 
ductive capacity 
microbial communities play several critical roles in

the soil including organic matter decomposition and

control of its cycle regulation of mineral nutrient
availability and nitrogen fixation thousands of
bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic organisms are
present in natural soil and collectively contribute to
maintaining the myriad of functions of soil microbial
inoculation of a biocontrol agent can cause tremen 
dous changes in the number and composition of
taxonomic groups these changes can increase the di 
versity of the soil samples while also having toxic ef 
fects on the indigenous microbes thus the
practical use of any microbial inoculation should be
rigorously tested in a laboratory setting to avoid any
deleterious effects to microbial diversity in soils to
this end we have rigorously tested the use of tp as a
biocontrol agent for the eradication of pd in cave and
mine soil samples and tp treatment in large had no
impact on the native microbial communities other
than pd 

conclusions
the present study demonstrates the remarkable speci 
ficity and high potency of tp for killing pd in the
presence of indigenous microbial communities with
minimal to no impact on the microbial community
