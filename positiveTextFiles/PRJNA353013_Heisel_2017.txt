abstract dietary fat intake and shifts in gut bacterial community composition are
associated with the development of obesity to date characterization of microbiota
in lean versus obese subjects has been dominated by studies of gut bacteria fungi 
recently shown to affect gut inflammation have received little study for their role in
obesity we sought to determine the effects of high fat diet on fungal and bacterial
community structures in a mouse model using the internal transcribed spacer region
 its of fungal ribosomal dna rdna and the s rrna genes of bacteria mice
fed a high fat diet had significantly different abundances of bacterial and fun 
gal taxa than did mice fed standard chow with high fat diet causing similar magni 
tudes of change in overall fungal and bacterial microbiome structures we observed
strong and complex diet specific coabundance relationships between intra and in 
terkingdom microbial pairs and dramatic reductions in the number of coabundance
correlations in mice fed a high fat diet compared to those fed standard chow fur 
thermore predicted microbiome functional modules related to metabolism were sig 
nificantly less abundant in high fat diet fed than in standard chow fed mice these
results suggest a role for fungi and interkingdom interactions in the association be 
tween gut microbiomes and obesity 

importance recent research shows that gut microbes are involved in the devel 
opment of obesity a growing health problem in developed countries that is linked
to increased risk for cardiovascular disease however studies showing links between
microbes and metabolism have been limited to the analysis of bacteria and have
ignored the potential contribution of fungi in metabolic health this study provides
evidence that ingestion of a high fat diet is associated with changes to the fungal
 and bacterial microbiome in a mouse model in addition we find that interking 
dom structural and functional relationships exist between fungi and bacteria within
the gut and that these are perturbed by high fat diet 

keywords fungal bacterial interactions fungi high fat diet microbiome obesity

emerging evidence demonstrates that diet both independently and in conjunctionwith body composition modulates gut microbial community structure the
resulting microbiome modulations from high fat diet in particular influence the risk for
development of obesity and obesity related disorders such as diabetes and atheroscle 
rosis – proposed mechanisms for microbially mediated obesity effects include
increased energy extraction from the diet production of neuroactive factors that
decrease satiety or increase hunger and induced inflammatory responses

the majority of studies examining the links between gut microbes and metabolic
health have focused almost exclusively on the bacterial component of the microbiota
 – even though microbes from other microbial kingdoms are present within the
intestinal tract in particular diverse fungal communities also colonize the intestinal
tract of humans and mice – importantly perturbation of bacterial communities 
for example by antibacterial antibiotics changes fungal communities as well as bac 
terial communities underlining the importance of considering interkingdom in 
teractions in studies seeking to understand microbiome mediated effects on human
health 

fungi have been reported to contribute less than of the microbes in the
intestinal tract of humans however this number likely underestimates fungal
numbers and importance of note there is underrepresentation of fungal sequences
in annotated reference sequence databases as of july the national center for
biotechnology information ncbi database listed complete fungal genomes
compared to complete bacterial genomes and so fungi may be underdetected
by shotgun sequencing efforts in addition fungal cells are more than fold larger
than typical bacterial cells thus they provide a substantial mass of biomaterial and
unique metabolic functions to the microbiota as well as surface area for host microbe
interactions although they represent a small component of the microbiota fungal
communities are significant in that they potentially serve as a reservoir for pathogens
as well as for keystone species with critical roles in maintaining the function of the gut
microbiome furthermore so called minor components of the microbiota can
nevertheless proliferate under certain host conditions such as those occurring with
antibiotic exposure with significant health consequences for the host 

in this study we sought to gain an understanding of how an obesogenic diet affects
host associated microbes beyond that which has been described for only one micro 
bial kingdom the bacteria we hypothesized that fungal microbiomes and specifically 
fungal bacterial microbiome interactions involved in metabolism would be disrupted
by high fat diet overall the results of this study provide evidence that fungi and
interkingdom interactions are disrupted by high fat diet thus supporting the inclusion
of fungal community analyses in studies that seek to discover new connections
between intestinal microbiomes and metabolic health

similarly to the fungal fungal network analysis the number of bacterial bacterial

idea that interkingdom interactions exist between bacteria and fungi in the gut and
that these relationships depend upon diet 

fungal taxa correlate with bacterial kegg modules inference of fungal micro 
biome function from sequence data is not technically possible due to the paucity of
fungal sequences in current databases complexities of fungal taxonomy calling and
variability in functions expressed by fungi depending on specific environmental con 
ditions compared to bacterial sequences nevertheless we were able to use bugbase
 to infer bacterial community functions of mouse gut microbiomes in order to
identify potential links between fungi and metabolic potential of gut bacterial micro

development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome these results along with the
results that we report here support the idea that gut fungal communities could
contribute to metabolic health 

the high fat diet provided to the mice in this study contained calories from fat
compared to for standard chow this high level of fat in a human diet would be
extreme and encountered rarely but is used in rodent models to induce obesity
because it allows the animals to gain more weight at a higher rate thus
allowing researchers to screen for effects after a shorter period of time additional
studies are needed to understand the effects on the mycobiome of diets containing
ranges of fat content as well as differences in fat types e g saturated versus unsat 
urated that are more typically consumed by human populations 

in lean mice fed a standard chow we observed that the fungal species s cerevisiae
was significantly more abundant than in obese mice fed a high fat diet this is
consistent with a recent report showing that saccharomyces species had significantly
lower abundance in the gut of obese children than in controls it remains unclear 
however whether the s cerevisiae abundance difference has a direct role in the
expression of obesity associated phenotypes by the host in support of a mechanistic
connection between gut fungi and metabolic health the administration of either chitin
or � glucan polysaccharide components of the cell walls of many fungal species 
including s cerevisiae or live saccharomyces boulardii an asporogenous form of
s cerevisiae to mice was shown to prevent obesity phenotypes induced by
high fat diet – these effects were associated with modulation of gut bacterial
community structure fungal microbiomes were not analyzed other fungal species
have also been implicated in beneficial effects on the host for example metabolites
from the penicillium genus have been reported to exhibit anti inflammatory and
insulin sensitizing activities altogether these results support the hypothesis that
gut fungal communities interact with the host to affect metabolism possibly via
fungus derived molecules and or by modulation of bacterial community functions 

our analysis of chow microbiomes revealed that they differ from the fungal micro

biomes of the murine gut we observed that although some fungal species were
shared between gut and chow many gut fungi were not present in the chow these
results indicate that recently ingested food is not the only source for gut fungi other
potential sources include other chows ingested by the mice prior to purchase animal
bedding and maternal sites with transfer of fungi occurring during birth and early life 
additionally the differences in relative abundances between fungi in chow and the
same fungal taxa found in the gut show that modulation of ingested fungal commu 
nities occurs within the mammalian gut open questions remain as to how fungal com 
munities are acquired and mature over time and which fungi persist in the mammalian gut
over the long term 

in this study intra and interkingdom coabundance relationships existed in the
murine gut and these relationships were specific to diet type our functional analysis
using bugbase and kegg pathways provides further evidence of shared physiochemical
interactions between bacteria and fungi and points to potential functional relationships
that may be disrupted by dietary changes in most environments fungi and bacteria
coexist and interact physically communicate with each other via molecules and
induction of signaling pathways modulate their shared physiochemical environment 
and compete with or complement each other with respect to nutrients metabolism 
and phoresis because of these interkingdom interactions mixed microbial com 
munities often have functional properties that are significantly different from each
single kingdom community for example in human subjects ingesting a high 
carbohydrate diet a syntrophic relationship was observed between the fungal genus

fig correlations between bacterial kegg modules and fungal taxa that increase with high fat a and standard chow b diet kegg modules were limited

candida and bacterial genera prevotella ruminococcus and methanobrevibacter 
the investigators proposed that digestion of dietary starch by candida results in the
release of simple sugars which are fermented by prevotella and ruminococcus metha 
nobrevibacter then completes the breakdown of fermentation by products to carbon
dioxide and or methane in our study mice fed a high fat diet had increased relative
abundance of the fungus aspergillus terreus a fungus that produces the cholesterol 
reducing agent lovastatin and this correlated with increases in bacterial genes
involved in carbon energy metabolism methanogenesis acetyl coa synthesis and
reductive acetyl coa pathways implying a compensatory response to exposure to
high fat diet in a recent study rats receiving a terreus as a dietary supplement along
with a high fat diet had reduced hepatic steatosis compared to those fed a high fat diet
alone further supporting a role for a terreus in modulation of metabolism there
is also evidence for fungal bacterial relationships in other scenarios that affect health 
for example administration of s boulardii to treat antibiotic associated diarrhea caused
by the bacterium clostridium difficile as well as intestinal inflammation caused by
the bacterium citrobacter rodentium in addition in our study we found a potential
correlation between the fungal taxon dioszegia and the phenotype “anaerobic bacte 
ria” across diets dioszegia has been proposed to be a “hub” fungal taxon that is it
influences total host microbiome structure and likely function via its numerous
interactions with other microbes that affect their colonization dynamics e g by
modulation of growth and or diversity altogether these collective results high 
light the potential importance of interkingdom interactions within the intestine for
their role in human metabolic health 

the findings presented here provide a broader understanding of changes in the gut
microbiome in association with high fat diet and obesity the role of microbes other
than bacteria and of interkingdom interactions in the development of human health
and disease should be a priority for future studies as the information gained could
allow the discovery of novel targets for treatment and prevention of obesity

	results
	mice fed a high fat diet harbor gut fungal and bacterial communities that differ from those in mice fed standard chow 
	fungal microbiomes of mouse feces differ from those present in the corresponding mouse chow 
	diet specific intrakingdom coabundance correlations exist in the mouse gut 
	diet specific fungal bacterial interkingdom coabundance correlations exist in the mouse gut 
	fungal taxa correlate with bacterial kegg modules
