dvances in sequencing technologies allow deeper studies of the soil protist diversity and function 
owever little attention has been given to the impact of the chosen soil dna extraction procedure to

btained from different sites with different land uses results from s rrna gene amplicon sequencing
uggest that dna extraction method significantly affect the replicate homogeneity the total number of
perational taxonomic units otus recovered and the overall taxonomic structure and diversity of soil
rotist communities however dna extraction effects did not overwhelm the natural variation among
amples as the community data still strongly grouped by geographical location the commercial dna
xtraction kit was associated with the highest diversity estimates and with a corresponding higher
etrieval of excavata cercozoa and amoebozoa related taxa overall our findings indicate that this
xtraction offers a compromise between rare and dominant taxa representation while providing high

active in important functions such as regulation
of bacterial biomass productivity and community
structure nutrient recycling and plant growth pro 
motion bonkowski geisen et al b 
moreover they are likely to harbour promising bio 
control agents protecting plants against pathogenic
fungi and plant pathogenic nematodes since it is
now known that some protists in soil are facultative
mycophagous and even omnivores geisen et al 
 a c still this fraction of the soil microbial
community remains relatively understudied when
compared to its bacterial and fungal counterparts
 geisen et al b lentendu et al 

previously the sensitivity of two manual dna
extraction methods iso method modified

dna isola 

tion kit were tested for the detection of protist
groups in a grassland and two arable sites santos
et al results revealed that the commer 
cial kit favours dna quality at the cost of dna
yields additionally higher numbers of eukaryotic
 s rrna gene copies were recovered from soil
with the commercial procedure this comparative
study was carried out using classical molecular
approaches i e pcr amplification evaluation and
quantification qpcr however no information on
the effects to the structure of the protist community
was obtained 

generally dna isolation is impaired by diffi 
cult accessibility to the target organism caused by
the complex soil characteristics and matrix and or
by insufficient cell lysis due to differences in the
cell wall composition and structure as observed
for bacterial strains salonen et al for
microeukaryotes with fortified cell walls or very
resilient cell membranes it is difficult to disrupt
cells with regular chemical processes this leads
to misrepresentation of certain microbial groups
and low reproducibility of the dna extraction meth 
ods carrigg et al frostegård et al 
plassart et al therefore the most acknowl 
edged soil dna extraction methods usually involve
direct lysis of cells based on bead beating protocols
 ogram et al which is less time consuming
and yields more dna than indirect extraction meth 
ods however shearing of dna increases with
lysis time and purification steps are needed due
to co extraction of humic acids that may interfere
with dna quantification and downstream molec 
ular applications delmont et al b jacquiod
et al lentendu et al zhou et al 
 consequently the natural variation arising

from soil types together with the choice of dna
extraction procedure is expected to influence the
final results obtained from current molecular anal 
ysis e g s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 
indeed plassart et al showed that differ 
ent soil physicochemical characteristics seemed to
be the pivotal factor affecting the bacterial commu 
nity recovered more recently wüst et al 
demonstrated that the choice of extraction proto 
cols affects the quality and quantity as well as the
phylogenetic prokaryotic composition of the result 
ing dna and rna extracts it has been suggested
that several soil sampling and dna extraction
strategies should be combined to access the whole
soil microbial diversity delmont et al a how 
ever this complementary approach is not suitable
or relevant to wide scale studies where time and
cost constrains the need to use a standardized sin 
gle dna extraction procedure terrat et al 

in the present study we examine how different
dna extraction approaches influence our assess 
ment of soil microbial communities by comparing
protist diversity and composition using the three
dna extraction procedures previously analysed
by santos et al soil protist community
structures were compared based on the amplifi 
cation of the hypervariable v fragments of the
ssu rrna gene and the number of operational
taxonomic units otus recovered pairwise com 
parisons were used to determine the presence of
large discrepancies in the relative abundance of
specific taxa due to dna extraction method 

results

initial sequence data analysis

protist s rrna gene fragments were suc 
cessfully amplified by pcr and sequenced
from all soils and for each of the three
dna extraction procedures a total of sam 
ples were sequenced resulting in 
 ± average ± standard error of the
mean across all samples s rrna gene high 
quality sequences with an average read length
of bp sequence clustering yielded 
eukaryotic otus ± representing an
average good’s coverage of ± finally 
after removal of otus affiliated to multicellular
organisms ± high quality
sequences were kept corresponding to 
 ± otus representing an average good’s
coverage of ± indicating an excel 
lent overall otu coverage afforded by the deep



dna extraction affects protist taxonomy 

sequencing the good’s coverage estimator dif 
fered according to the soil type and the dna
extraction method used indicating deeper recov 
ery of the community constituents across lancaster
and castro verde sites with the manual meth 
ods table moreover the rarefaction curves
of the mobio dna extraction showed the gen 
eral trend for all the samples where asymptotic
levels were reached indicating sufficient sequenc 
ing completeness to account for core community
diversity detectable using s targeted primers
 supplementary material fig s in order to focus
on extraction method dependent variations venn
diagrams were created for an overview of shared
otus across the different dna extraction methods
per site supplementary material fig s a total
of and otus were shared among
the three dna extraction methods for castro verde 
lancaster and scheyern sites respectively sup 
plementary material fig s additionally the
commercial kit recovered a higher percentage of
unique otus for castro verde and lancaster sites 
while the isom recovered a higher number of otus
for the scheyern site however when looking at
the otus recovered by all dna extraction meth 
ods they represented a considerable proportion of
the total sequence abundance for all sites 
 supplementary material fig s indicating that all
methods could recover the most prominent taxa 

soil protist diversity and composition

protist alpha diversity in the samples was anal 
ysed by two way permanova to determine the
impact of dna extraction method at each site
 table significant shifts on alpha diversity were
detected for all parameters except chao with the
dna extraction and the soil site as factors rich 
ness as the number of observed otus seemed to
be significantly affected by dna extraction method
in the lancaster site indicating that the commercial
kit and the gns gii method recovered the high 
est number of otus table the mean values of
observed otus across all dna extraction methods
ranged from ± extracted with isom 
and ± extracted with the commercial
kit both from the lancaster site shannon index
was significantly different according to site with
castro verde and scheyern showing the lowest
values table at scheyern significant differences
were also observed between mobio and gns gii 
with the first method recovering higher diversity 
the mean shannon diversity across all dna extrac

samples extracted with the mobio kit cluster apart
from the others fig these observations were
reinforced by simper analysis revealing an over 
all average divergence of and
 among the dna extractions for castro

moreover the interaction between soil site and
dna extraction was significant when a global nega 
tive binomial model nbglm was applied table 
therefore to investigate whether intrinsic environ 
mental parameters control protists recovered by the
different dna extraction methods we performed
permutational multivariate analysis of variance for
each site individually the results are given in
supplementary material supplementary material
table s at each site the most significant factor
was the dna extraction method used whereas only
moisture content in lancaster site was also signif 
icant additionally we generated a nmds graph

ables by permanova supplementary material
fig s and table s from this an environmen 
tal gradient associated with moisture and total c
content could be seen the latter being negatively
associated with ph consequently we evaluated
which of the three extraction methods was the most
effective for discriminating differences in protist
communities resulting from site specific physico 
chemical characteristics table all methods
showed similar results in discriminating commu 
nity differences due to soil site r between 
and albeit the commercial protocol seemed to

explain a higher percentage table these
analyses establish that geographical location and
dna extraction method both have a major impact
on observed community structure at all taxonomic
levels 

furthermore nbglm analysis recovered a
large number of taxa that differed significantly in

the effect of soil site can be also observed in
figure for example isom recovered more
sequences belonging to variosea group at schey 
ern site however at castro verde site mobio
showed higher recovery rates a similar pattern
can be found for the gregarine taxa in schey 
ern and lancaster site where mobio and manual
methods performed differently mobio was effective
in recovering a large diversity of unknown gre 
garines from scheyern site however the manual
methods performed better for the lancaster site 

discussion and conclusions

the variation arising from soil types together with
the choice of dna extraction procedure is expected
to influence the final result obtained from current
molecular analysis e g s rrna gene amplicon
sequencing such effects can be expressed as
measures of community structure alpha and beta 
diversity and may also result in significant impacts
in comparative analyses penton et al 
based on our s rrna gene sequence analysis 
the choice of dna extraction method significantly
influenced the overall protist community structure
as measured by otu richness evenness diver 
sity and the dispersion among replicates contrary
to the results of terrat et al on soil bac 
terial community composition no differences were
observed in terms of replicate variation between
isom and gns gii methods for protist community 
however a higher reproducibility between repli 
cates was observed for samples extracted with the

tion anova p were centered and scaled to the average of each taxon’s relative abundance sample
constrained clustering and simper analysis were based on bray curtis dissimilarity index rioja r package 
overall average dissimilarity of the taxa was the colour keys at the beginning of each row and column
show sample origins and taxonomic affiliations of displayed taxa respectively 

mobio method the higher number of otus recov 
ered by the mobio approach in most sites was
preceded by a higher level of dna purity in terms
of od ratio and a higher absolute abundance
of s rrna genes previously recovered by qpcr
 santos et al therefore the higher richness
associated with mobio extraction and lower varia 
tion among replicates indicates that this approach
is the most suitable for protist diversity assessments
at these three sites 

the implementation of only small beads in the
commercial kit in contrast to the manual tech 
niques could be one of the factors responsible for
the higher recovery of protist otus it has been
reported that various kinds of microbial cells in
water soil and sediment samples could be dis 
rupted with beads of different materials and sizes 
likewise the amount of beads the speed and the
temperature during bead beating have all been
shown to have an effect on extraction efficiency
 bürgmann et al wintzingerode et al 
the existence of unique taxa obtained by each

of the methods might be a decisive factor for
choosing the dna extraction method to be used
in an experiment especially if targeting specific
protist groups the summary of the most diver 
gent otus according to the dna extraction method
shows that some cercozoa taxa were recovered in
higher relative abundance by mobio cercozoans
are known to be ecologically significant in soils 
being important bacterial predators geisen et al 
 b howe et al amoebozoans which
display a large and mostly uncharacterized diversity
in soils geisen et al b were also recovered
in higher relative abundance by mobio fig the
conosa group amoebozoa includes taxa such
as acanthamoeba known to be prevalent in soil 
responsible for major ecological roles in grassland
ecosystems and also to be consistently overlooked
by both traditional and molecular sampling method 
ologies fiore donno et al gns gii method 
on the other hand recovered higher relative abun 
dances of stramenopiles super group showing that
applied combination of chemical lysis and different



 s s santos et al 

bead sizes was beneficial this group can include
plant pathogen taxa of economic importance as
they are known to cause extensive damage to tree
roots in natural forest soils marano et al 

the effect of the interaction between soil type 
their inherent environmental variables and dna
extraction method was also observed for the group
of gregarines this is a diverse group of apicom 
plexan known to form very resistant cysts and live
as parasites in terrestrial freshwater and marine
environments wakeman et al this is a
group of interest for soil studies since it includes
a vast diversity of obligate parasites of terrestrial
insects and the more general apicomplexa group
includes the causative agents of malaria coccid 
iosis cryptosporidiosis and toxoplasmosis dupont
et al 

it is known that dna yield is strongly depen 
dent upon soil type due to ph organic matter 
water content and clay and silt content as these
factors can influence either the growth of certain
microbial taxa the formation of aggregates which
host microorganisms or the binding of dna to
soil particles plassart et al saeki et al 
 sagova mareckova et al wüst et al 
 altogether environmental factors such as
ph total c content and moisture helped to shape
unique communities of protist in the soils stud 
ied nevertheless these factors were previously
reported to influence dna extraction purity and
pcr performance sagova mareckova et al 
and therefore to influence the recovery efficiency of
the dna extractions as a result the implications of
different extraction methods for estimates of protist
diversity in soils are particularly relevant for stud 
ies of the interdependence of microbial diversity
and environmental parameters across physico 
chemical diverse soils this illustrates the essential
requirement for reproducibility and consistency in
extraction methods when comparing studies the
significance of standardized dna extraction meth 
ods for microbial community characterization is
clear martin laurent et al terrat et al 
vishnivetskaya et al however the value
of the gained resolution by mobio kit needs to
be considered relative to the variation of the fea 
tures attributes of the system under study and the
resolution needed to answer the research question 

methods

sampling from the top cm was previously described by

three different sites belonging to two different land uses

sequences were processed and assessed for quality fil 
tered on the basis of quality q score sequence length
and pcr primer trimming by following the high resolution
unoise pipeline with usearch v edgar briefly 
overlapping reads were merged and subsequently quality
filtered based on a maximum expected error per read of 
by using a fastq maxee option to fastq filter command 
after quality filtering the following steps were taken using
the unoise pipeline with default settings unless stated
otherwise dereplication of redundant sequences 
unoise command to perform denoising error correction of
amplicon reads and creation of an otu table assembled
sequences were phylogenetically assigned with the uclust
consensus taxonomy assigner edgar against the pr 
database guillou et al with a threshold of similarity
 dupont et al geisen et al a otus affiliated
with metazoan fungi and embryophytes as multicellular
organisms have been excluded before further analyses bates
et al grossmann et al for the alpha diversity
analysis and to avoid biases related with sample size the
number of reads per sample was normalized by random
subsampling to reads the raw amplicon sequence data



dna extraction affects protist taxonomy 

sets are available on the ncbi sequence read archive sra 
under project accession number prjna 

statistical and cluster analysis all statistical tests per 
formed in this study were considered significant at p 
unless otherwise indicated however we provide the pre 
cise p values wherever possible estimates of alpha diversity
were based on evenly rarefied otu abundance matrices and
included observed richness chao shannon and equitabil 
ity indices as calculated in qiime v alpha diversity py 
equitability is defined in qiime as h log s where h is
the shannon index and s is the number of observed otus 
sampling effort was estimated using good’s coverage com 
plement of the ratio between local singleton otus and the total
sequence count as described by good also calculated
in qiime rarefaction curves of the observed richness were
calculated using the past software hammer et al on
non rarefied and rarefied counts per sample supplementary
material fig s the effect of dna extraction and soil site on
alpha diversity indices was tested with two way permanova
with vegan package oksanen et al of the r software
version r development core team 

the relationship between microbial communities derived
from different samples was first visualized using venn diagrams
 limma package smyth patterns of sample dissimilarity
were further visualized using a principal component analysis
 pca after center scaling normalization ade package dray
and dufour a constrained ordination was applied to the
pca by grouping the samples according to the dna extrac 
tion method within each site using the between group analysis
method bga similarly to jacquiod et al the statistical
significance of the selected grouping factor was tested with a
monte carlo simulation using permutations 

we used bray–curtis relative abundance metrics to cal 
culate pairwise community distance matrices and examine
differences in beta diversity a non metric multidimensional
scaling nmds was constructed to examine the robustness
of the sample clustering samples were fitted as centroids 
and soil characteristic variables were fitted as vectors onto
the ordination plots using the ‘envfit’ function in the vegan
package statistical differences in community composition
between locations and dna extraction methods were analysed
by permanova anderson permdist anderson
 and by fitting the compositional data to a general 
ized negative binomial model followed by an analysis of
deviance mvabund package wang et al all tests
were computed using permutations for significance 
testing finally we conducted a similarity of percentage
analysis simper and anova with a false discovery rate
using the benjamini hochberg correction fdr qiime v 
group significance py in order to determine the taxa that con 
tributed the most for the differences in relative abundance
among the dna extraction methods the selected taxa were
plotted in a heat map of centered and scaled counts as per 
formed by jacquiod et al mvabund – wang et al 
rioja – juggins made – culhane et al packages
