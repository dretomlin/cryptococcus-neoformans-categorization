abstract wastewater can be recycled in agricultural soil

as fertilizer to increase crop yields however adding

wastewater induces sometimes ecotoxicological issues

such as pollution by toxic compounds which may lead to

the loss of arable land bioenergy crops such asmiscanthus

 giganteus have been tested to rehabilitate polluted soils 

but the impact of miscanthus on soil microbes is unknown 

here we evaluated the effects of miscanthus cropping on

bacterial and fungal taxonomic composition in a wastew 

ater contaminated soil using synchronic and diachronic

evaluation strategies a year field experiment close to

paris was set up on an agricultural site irrigated by raw

wastewater for more than one century thus resulting in

strong metal and organic contamination soil microbial

taxonomic composition was characterized by direct anal 

ysis of soil dna using metagenomic tools such as 

pyrosequencing of ribosomal genes our results demon 

strate that miscanthus cropping stimulates specific popu 

lations of bacteria such as rhizobiales increased by in

relative abundance nistrospira x azospira x and

gemmatimonas x and fungi glomeromycota x and

mortierella x for fungi noteworthy these microbial

genera are known to be strongly involved in plant sym 

biosis organic matter mineralization and nutrient cycling 

overall our findings show that miscanthus cropping

enhances regeneration of soil microbiological functions

and services in polluted soil by stimulating populations

beneficial for soil fertility and crop production

miscanthus giganteus � rehabilitation � trace metals

introduction

in france million hectares of soil are used for agri 

culture i e about of the surface area of the french

national territory in these soils to limit intensive farming and

the input of chemical fertilizer alternative strategy has been

developed such as the reuse of raw municipal wastewater for

irrigation to date about of the agricultural land surface

was irrigated with wastewater improving soil fertility and

crop productivity http www agreste agriculture gouv fr

products of disinfection industrial contaminants microor 

ganisms inorganic and organic compounds and pharma 

ceuticals and personal care products therefore such

practices often result in ecotoxicological and sanitary prob 

lems due to the high level of accumulation of toxic exogenous

consequences on soil fertility several studies have inves 

tigated the ecological impact of irrigation with wastewater

on soil microbial communities in certain cases raw

wastewater irrigation stimulated microbial abundance and

diversity demonstrating a positive effect of this practice

 hidri et al contrastingly other studies highlighted

that the high accumulation of trace metals and organic

pollutants could also lead to an alteration of microbial

abundance and important shifts in community diversity and

composition kandeler et al ranjard et al 

with strong repercussions on soil biological functioning

and ecosystem services bååth et al as a conse 

quence soils irrigated with wastewater become unsuit 

able for crop production over several generations due to the

decrease in soil fertility and or hazards of food quality for

human consumption 

in a context of loss of surface area of arable land in

france and more widely in europe due to intensive agri 

culture leading to soil erosion acidification and pollution 

it is now crucial to develop strategy for restoring these soils

by the improvement of their soil biological patrimony in

this context phytoremediation technologies have been

developed during the last decade which consists of

growing plants on polluted soil with an aim to improve

stabilization of the metals in soils or plants and thus

reducing their biological toxicity and depth migration

 pavel et al furthermore plant cover also prevents

bulk erosion and improves soil carbon sequestration which

can further limit the toxicity and vertical transfer of metals 

recently another strategy has been developed to rehabil 

itate agricultural activity on polluted soils the use of plants

for bioenergy production evangelou et al one of

the most used plants for bioenergy crop is the c grass

miscanthus giganteus which is suitable for biofuel crop

in europe lewandowski et al previous studies

have demonstrated that miscanthus crop stimulates posi 

tively the abundance and diversity of soil collombola

 chauvat et al as well as the resident detritivores

and rhizophagous species of soil invertebrates hedde et al 

 few works have investigated its impact on soil

microbial communities 

in a previous study we have demonstrated that planting

giant miscanthus on agricultural soils polluted by a long 

term raw wastewater irrigation modifies microbial com 

munity by stimulating bacterial and fungal diversity in

terms of richness number of species and evenness

 bourgeois et al these first results revealed that the

implantation of bioenergy crop on polluted soil may rep 

resent a good strategy to restore soil microbiological pat 

rimony it is now important to elucidate which microbial

populations are shifted by miscanthus implantation in

order to better understand the functions and more widely

the services that may be subsequently restored 

the aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of

miscanthus giganteus cropping on the indigenous

microbial community composition in a long term con 

taminated soil investigations were carried out on a real 

field location close to paris pierrelaye france which had

been irrigated with raw wastewater for more than

 years these inputs led to the accumulation of a huge

amount of recalcitrant organic matter especially in the soil

surface horizon as well as micropollutants especially zn 

pb cu and cd trace metals lamy et al van oort

et al the short term impact of mxg on microbial

communities was assessed by a synchronic comparative

study of plots planted with giant miscanthus for years

and a plot under a conventional wheat crop system and by

 a diachronic study monitoring bacterial and fungal

community dynamics during year period following the

planting of miscanthus microbial communities were

characterized in terms of bacterial and fungal composition

by identifying the different dominant taxonomic groups by

high throughput sequencing pyrosequencing of

ribosomal genes s rrna for bacteria and s rrna for

fungi we hypothesized that miscanthus crops may restore

the soil biological functioning through the stimulation of

microbial populations involved in close direct interactions

with plants i e symbiosis and in nutrient cycling by

providing new soil habitats and less recalcitrant organic

matter leading to an increase in soil fertility and plant

productivity in polluted soils

experimental site history and soil sampling design

 iuss working group wrb for more than a cen 

tury they have been used for market gardening and irri 

gated with raw wastewater from the urban paris in order to

increase the organic quality of this soil by supplying c n 

and k inputs however they also led to the accumulation

of recalcitrant organic matter dissolved salts carbonates 

phosphates and metallic pollutants in the surface horizon

of the soil lamy et al van oort et al as a

consequence the spreading of raw wastewater was finally

stopped in the early s and the market gardening was

prohibited to promote cereal cropping and to introduce

bioenergy crops especially the c grass miscanthus 

giganteus the experimental site in this agricultural area

results and discussion

on the pierrelaye site irrigation with wastewater led to an

important accumulation of recalcitrant organic matter high

was previously described by lamy et al table 

in a previous study we have designed synchronic and

diachronic studies to demonstrate a positive effect of

miscanthus crop on the bacterial and fungal diversity in

terms of number of taxons and evenness bourgeois et al 

 the goal of the present work is to identify precisely

the bacterial and fungal populations stimulated by mis 

canthus crop and to deduce the microbial functions that

may be potentially restored 

influence of wastewater irrigation on soil

microbiological composition

detailed analysis of the bacterial composition in the dif 

ferent plots revealed similar patterns of population struc 

ture dominated by genera such as pedomicrobium 

hyphomicrobium massilia and flavisolibacter known to

be resistant to heavy metals or organic micropollutants and

characteristic of contaminated soils fig a c girvan

et al hong et al moreover bacteria

belonging to the genus holophaga relative abundance

from to are known to be involved in sulfide

methylation of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocar 

bon degradation rosenzweig et al whereas those

belonging to genus steroidobacter from to are

involved in hormone degradation fahrbach et al 

fungal communities were also impacted by organic matter

quality and the historical site pollution the fungal com 

munity in all plots was dominated by genera belonging to

the phylum ascomycota with coniochaeta fusarium and

chaetomium which are known to be metal tolerant

 fig b d iram et al however fungi from the

phylum basidiomycota were also well represented from 

to data not shown and these fungi are known to

thrive in forest soils because of their ability to degrade

recalcitrant organic matter with a high c n ratio and lignin

content baldrian and snajdr consequently the

prevalence of such populations in the wastewater contam 

inated soils can be explained by the high recalcitrance of

soil organic matter observed in the studied plots

cant shifts in fungal taxonomic composition occurred

between annual and perennial cropping anosim signif 

icance fig b this observation was in agree 

ment with previous results revealing a positive effect of

miscanthus crop on fungal community diversity richness

 bourgeois et al more precisely fungi belonging to

the genus mortierella were increased under the miscanthus

crop for p compared with for p fig b 

these fungi are highly opportunistic and are known to

degrade fresh organic matter thus providing readily

available nutrients for plants and organisms tardy et al 

 showed that mortierellaceae proliferate during the

initial phase of crop litter decomposition due to their rapid

growth on simple organic matter in our case the stimu 

lation of mortierella may reflect an increase in easily

decomposable c substrates in the soil consistent with an

enhanced release of root exudates by the perennial mis 

canthus crop finally the phylum glomeromycota was also

more prevalent under miscanthus crop than under the

conventional crop system relative abundance for p 

compared to for p data not shown these arbus 

cular mycorrhizal fungi live in symbiosis with plants

through their root systems providing a higher intake of

nutrients for plant growth with a direct impact on crop

productivity and also a higher resistance against soil

pathogens smith and read 

our synchronic study demonstrated that years of

miscanthus perennial cropping had no significant impact

on the bacterial community but led to a shift in fungal

community diversity and composition such discrepancy

may reflect that perennial miscanthus cropping is also

associated with halting of agricultural practices such as

tillage known to affect mainly fungal communities the

stimulation of root associated genera suggests that mis 

canthus cropping is beneficial to the re establishment of

ecological interactions between plant and soil communities

in contaminated soils which could in turn provide potential

advantages for plant growth and crop production

importance at this site where the organic matter is rather

the synchronic and diachronic evaluations of the effect

munity in a long term wastewater contaminated site high 

lighted positive effects on microbial community

composition and soil biological quality the shifts in

microbial composition resulted systematically from the

stimulation of populations involved in plant root associa

crop may induce a restart of biotic interactions between

plants and organisms as well as of organic matter miner 

alization and nitrogen cycle this shift in community

composition could lead to the improvement in soil organic

matter turnover which is low in these soils due to the high
