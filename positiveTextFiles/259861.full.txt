abstract 
freshwater is an essential resource of increasing value as clean water sources diminish microorganisms 
in rivers a major source of renewable freshwater are significant due to their role in drinking water safety 
signalling environmental contamination and driving global nutrient cycles however a foundational 
understanding of microbial communities in rivers is lacking especially temporally and for viruses – no 
studies to date have examined the composition of the free floating river virome over time and 
explanations of the underlying causes of spatial and temporal changes in riverine microbial composition 
especially for viruses remain unexplored here we report relationships among riverine microbial 
communities and their environment across time space and superkingdoms viruses bacteria and 
microeukaryotes using metagenomics and marker based microbiome analysis methods we found that 
many superkingdom pairs were synchronous and had consistent shifts with sudden environmental change 
however synchrony strength and relationships with environmental conditions varied across space and 
superkingdoms variable relationships were observed with seasonal indicators and chemical conditions 
previously found to be predictive of bacterial community composition – emphasizing the complexity 
of riverine ecosystems and raising questions around the generalisability of single site and bacteria only 
studies in this first study of riverine viromes over time dna viral communities were stably distinct 
between sites suggesting the similarity in riverine bacteria across significant geographic distances – 
does not extend to viruses and synchrony was surprisingly observed between dna and rna viromes 
this work provides foundational data for riverine microbial dynamics in the context of environmental and 
chemical conditions and illustrates how a bacteria only or single site approach would lead to an incorrect 
description of microbial dynamics we show how more holistic microbial community analysis including 
viruses is necessary to gain a more accurate and deeper understanding of microbial community dynamics

main 
bacterial diversity and composition in rivers is shaped by water temperature day length ph 
nutrients water residency time and storm events reviewed in balancing these shaping 
forces dispersal appears to play a large role both within and among – rivers such that 
bacterial community similarity does not necessarily decrease with increasing geographic 
distance less is known about planktonic free floating microeukaryotes in rivers however they 
appear to vary seasonally with light changes – with some evidence indicating the importance 
of algae as an energy source 

in contrast to this basic characterisation of bacterial and microeukaryote community variability 
little is known about the community dynamics of free floating viruses viroplankton in rivers – 
river planktonic viral metagenomes viromes have been reported in two studies however 
these studies had limited sample sizes and did not sample over time viral communities in lakes 
and oceans are better studied however these viromes are likely distinct from those in rivers 
given their differing hydrology and bacterial community compositions to date there have 
been no large scale studies of viroplankton composition in flowing lotic freshwater as such 
little is known about their community composition – and basic questions such as their 
variability throughout a year and the relative importance of dispersal and shaping forces in their 
community composition have gone unanswered 

fundamental knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of river plankton can support 
downstream development of improved water quality indicators to this end we profiled viral 
bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in rivers across differing land uses and 
environmental conditions we sampled microorganisms monthly for one year from six sites in 
three watersheds in southwestern british columbia canada figure a for each sample we 
performed metagenomic and or phylogenetic marker gene sequencing s s g viral 
capsid for dna viruses rna viruses bacteria and microeukaryotes environmental 
chemical and biological measures were also collected positive and negative controls were 
included and qpcr validation of select microbial groups was performed data not shown due 
to the lack of reference genomes available for freshwater viruses and the high complexity of the 
communities we estimated dissimilarity measures among metagenomes using a reference and 
assembly free k mer approach mash to diminish any effects from potential bacterial or 
eukaryotic contamination in the viral data dna and rna viromes are represented by two 
datasets the “total” dataset includes all sequence reads the “conservative” dataset is a subset of 
reads selected based on similarity to known viruses see methods for details spatiotemporal 
comparisons were performed within and between “superkingdoms” including viruses dna and 
rna bacteria and microeukaryotes and “environmental conditions” including catchment area 
weather river water chemical concentrations and river water physical conditions

lower confidence correlations were observed to reduce artefacts from arbitrary statistical cut off values e network 
of correlations among environmental conditions with edges calculated as in d with green edges for positive 
correlations and pink for negative nodes were arranged manually for legibility 
 

across superkingdoms hours of daylight and rainfall intensity were the most commonly 
correlated with community composition figure c d this pattern was particularly strong 
where rainfall and hours of daylight were correlated figure c sites aup apl ads extended 
data fig b c d but weak in sites where they were not figure c sites pup upl uds 
extended data fig a e f this is surprising as rainfall was hypothesized to have a 
particularly large and consistent impact on microbial communities since its intensity can affect 
microbial transport both overland and within stream transport instead when not confounded 
with overall seasonal changes hours of daylight rainfall was rarely significantly correlated with 
microbial community composition overall no correlations between environmental conditions 
and superkingdoms were seen in all sites figure c emphasizing the variability of river 
microbial community relationships with their environment 

environmental conditions that have been reported to drive bacterial community composition 
were heterogeneously correlated across sites and did not extend to other superkingdoms for 
example nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were most often correlated with rna viruses 
and or microeukaryotes but not with bacteria and ph was only correlated with bacterial 
composition in two sites despite a previous single time point study finding it to be a major 
driver very few correlations were observed with dissolved oxygen concentration flow 
intensity specific conductivity or turbidity the range of correlations with environmental 
conditions observed across sites and superkingdoms emphasizes both the complexity and 
heterogeneity of riverine microbial ecosystems 

despite inconsistent relationships with environmental conditions viral and bacterial community 
compositions shifted in similar patterns over time were “synchronous” with the strength of 
synchrony varying among sampling sites figure b extended data fig microeukaryotes 
had fewer synchronous relationships but were correlated with bacteria and or dna viruses in 
some sites the lack of synchrony between microeukaryotes and rna viruses could reflect 
infection patterns the cases of synchrony likely imply that the community compositions 
changed in response to a varying third factor e g through competition or that dispersal 
introduced new organisms that caused community shifts in most cases synchronous pairs were 
not significantly associated with a common third measure extended data fig the 
synchronous relationships most commonly observed here agree with a single site marine study 
however the diversity of sites presented here provide important counter examples to this 
emerging trend

unexpectedly dna and rna viral community compositions were synchronous in some sites 
 metagenomic and phylogenetic marker gene data mantel’s r q even 
though they were not consistently synchronous with bacteria or microeukaryotes extended data 
fig because few if any studies have profiled dna and rna viral community compositions 
concurrently over time this synchrony has not been previously investigated while correlational 
data cannot prove the drivers of synchrony environmental data can provide context 
synchronous dna and rna viromes were correlated with daylight hours extended data fig 
 and a temporal trend is clear sequential samples tended to be most alike and shift stepwise 
over time figure a at one site for other sites see extended data fig this suggests that the 
dna and rna viral synchrony is not artefactual but due to some temporal relationship 
possibly with a common host group or synchronous groups 

large shifts in dna and rna viromes in agriculturally affected sites were concurrent with the 
onset of rainfall after a dry period figure a extended data fig this trend was also 
observed in the other sampling sites and in bacterial communities figure b microeukaryotic 
communities not tested due to insufficient data these observations demonstrate the first flush 
phenomenon dry periods permit a buildup of solids chemicals metals and organisms and the 
first significant rainfall causes an abrupt shift in the bacterial and viral communities in the 
receiving waters – this shows that while continuous relationships with rainfall were not 
universal figure response to a rainfall event was more common

correspond to the first and third quartiles the whiskers extend to the highest and lowest values that are within

while sampling site was a significant source of variation for all microbial groups dna viromes 
showed stronger geographic based similarity than bacteria and microeukaryotes figure 
extended data fig this is consistent with the distinctiveness of t like bacteriophage seen 
in a study of polar lakes it is in contrast with the similarity of dna viruses seen in two 
temperate lakes however these lakes are connected and have similar surrounding land use 
analysing bacterial amplicon data at a finer taxonomic resolution identity otus did not 
significantly increase its geographic distinctiveness data not shown this lower geographic 
distinctiveness of bacteria particularly among sites with similar land use pairwise 
npmanova between the two agriculturally affected sites and between the two urban affected 
sites r q extended data fig is consistent with previously shown low 
spatial stratification of bacteria among rivers – in the one case where land use varied within a 
watershed figure a aup versus apl ads land use and associated water chemistry 
differences appeared to override geographic proximity as a predictor of microbial community 
similarity extended data fig these findings support a major ecological role of dispersal at 
this geographic scale – km for riverine bacterial and microeukaryotic plankton but 
reveals that viruses have a more distinct geographic pattern 

the higher geographic specificity of viruses observed here could reflect higher geographic 
specificity of host cells not sampled in this study such as particle associated plankton riverbed 
biofilms plants humans or other animals alternatively viruses may be more geographically 
distinct because they replicate in the subset of microbial cells in the community that are active 
 estimated at of bacterial cells this subset is more likely to be geographically distinct 
due to their increased susceptibility to selective pressures and more likely to be represented by 
viruses due to the mechanics of the lytic cycle and host specificity thus we hypothesise that 
viruses may produce a stronger geographic signal than bacteria by amplifying the effect of 
species sorting against the background of widely dispersed inactive cells

in conclusion temporal and spatial profiling revealed contrasting patterns among superkingdoms 
and environmental conditions in riverine microbial plankton some relationships were common 
such as microbial composition with day light hours and rainfall and expected correlations were 
observed such as between bacterial communities and ph however by examining multiple 
locations these relationships were revealed not to be universal even within similar sampling 
sites this demonstrates the heterogeneity of riverine microbial ecosystems and the need for 
multi site studies in riverine microbial ecology as a similar study of a single site may have 
falsely concluded general trends by examining multiple superkingdoms correlations with 
nutrient concentrations were identified that would have been missed if only bacteria were 
profiled and the strong dispersal observed in bacteria and microeukaryotes was revealed not to 
extend to viruses in summary this study provides insight into the variability of microbiomes 
over superkingdoms time and space in an important yet understudied environment it reveals 
notable differences in community dynamics across microbial groups and demonstrates the value 
of collectively studying microeukaryotes bacteria and viruses across multiple time points and 
locations in microbiome studies 

 

methods 
sampling sequencing 
river water was collected monthly for to consecutive months from six sites in three 
watersheds in southwestern british columbia canada the agricultural watershed had three 
sampling sites one upstream of human activity aup one adjacent to intensive agriculture 
 apl and one further downstream ads the urban watershed had two sampling sites one 
with a catchment mix of forest and residential land use upl and one further downstream with 
mostly residential and some park land use uds the pristine watershed was in a protected 
forest area with no land use pup sampling sites were not downstream of any lakes or dams 
water temperatures ranged from °c to °c in the agricultural watershed a distinct rainy 
period occurred from november to march which is typical for the area the other watersheds 
had more variable rainfall throughout the year sites from the same watershed were sampled on 
the same day for full sampling and sequencing procedures see and a brief overview 
follows 

at each sampling event l of water was collected and then filtered sequentially to concentrate 
particles approximating the sizes of microeukaryotes to µm bacteria to µm and 
viral sized particles physical and chemical water measurements were also taken dna was 
extracted from each size fraction along with rna from the viral sized fraction 

amplicons for t like bacteriophages were prepared using primers targeting the myovirus g 
gene amplicons for bacteria were prepared using primers targeting the v v regions of 
 s rrna gene amplicons for microeukaryotes were prepared using primers targeting the 
v v regions of the s rrna gene amplicons were purified with a qiaquick pcr 
purification kit qiagen sciences maryland md according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
sequencing libraries were prepared for amplicons using nextflex chip seq kit bioo

bacterial metagenome libraries were prepared using nextera xt dna sample preparation kit 
 illumina inc san diego ca and size selected using high throughput gel based ranger 
technology bacterial metagenomes were sequenced over multiple runs with bp paired end 
reads on an illumina miseq with positive controls mock communities and negative 
controls included in each run 

a modified adapter nonamer approach was used to synthesize viral cdna and increase yields 
from the viral fraction viral metagenome libraries were prepared from randomly amplified 
dna and cdna using nextflex chip seq kit bioo scientific austin tx by following a 
gel free option provided in the manufacturer’s instructions these libraries were sequenced with 
 bp paired end reads on an illumina hiseq platform illumina inc san diego ca 

dna sequence pre processing and quality control 
low quality bases were trimmed from the ’ end of reads using a sliding window with a 
minimum phred score of or for g using trimmomatic adapters were removed using 
cutadapt with default parameters paired end reads were merged using pear 
microeukaryotic s amplicon paired end reads could not be merged so operational taxonomic 
units otus were generated from reads with the same primer sequence 

t like myovirus g amplicons reads were translated into amino acid sequences using 
fraggenescan v with the illumina error model rho tang and ye otus were 
generated using usearch v sequences were dereplicated clustered at identity then all 
reads were mapped back against cluster representatives to calculate abundances sample read 
totals were subsampled to reads using the vegan package in r v random 
resampling was performed times and the median value of all iterations was chosen 
bacterial s and microeukaryotic s otus were generated from amplicon reads using the 
mothur miseq clustering protocol and rarefied to reads 

metagenomic reads were trimmed at the ’ end with a sliding window with a minimum phred 
score of using trimmomatic dna virome reads shorter than bp were discarded 
resulting in a dataset of gb in m reads rna virome reads shorter than bp were 
discarded and ribosomal reads were removed using meta rrna resulting in a dataset of gb 
across m reads bacterial metagenome reads shorter than bp were discarded resulting in 
a dataset of gbp across m reads 

generation of high confidence dna rna virome datasets 
viromes were assembled using clc and proteins were predicted from contigs using prodigal in 
metagenomic mode with default parameters predicted proteins at least amino acids long were 
clustered de novo using parallel cd hit with criteria as previously used word length of and 
 identity over length of the shorter sequence reads were assigned to clusters with a

for primary analysis as many samples had a small proportion of reads in any protein cluster 
 mean range of dna virus reads and mean range for rna virus 
reads 

contigs were tested for amino acid sequence similarity to reference sequences in ncbi’s nr 
database using rapsearch and taxonomically classified using megan a small proportion of 
contigs were assigned as dna viral of contigs of total reads and rna viral of 
contigs of total reads 

in the dna virome dataset of contigs were assigned as bacterial corresponding to of 
assembled reads and of total reads to assess whether these bacterial assignments were due 
to miss assignment of viral sequences e g auxiliary metabolic genes prophages or an 
indication of bacterial contamination e g from laboratory reagents free floating dna or host 
dna packaged in viral capsid reads were tested for the presence of bacterial genes unlikely to 
occur in viruses across read subsets of samples similarity to the s rrna gene was 
found in to reads mean standard deviation though these are small numbers they 
are an indication of the number of bacterial genomes potentially present this means that the 
contigs identified as bacterial in the taxonomic results cannot be ruled out as bacterial 
contamination further the contigs that were left unassigned by the taxonomic classification also 
cannot be ruled out as bacterial 

to remove potential bacterial contamination from the dna and rna viromes subsets of the 
read data were generated that only included sequences from protein clusters with at least one 
member that was assigned as coming from dna or rna viruses respectively this reduced the 
number of reads per sample from in the “total” dataset to in the “conservative” 
subset for dna viromes and from to for rna viromes as this is a fairly small 
number of reads we estimated the stability of distance matrices with low numbers of reads see 
below and used both total and conservative datasets to test trends 

sample similarity estimation spatiotemporal analysis 
pairwise similarity between amplicon samples was performed using vegan in r to calculate 
bray curtis dissimilarity between otu abundance profiles pairwise similarity between 
metagenomes was assessed using mash distances v which compares metagenomes based 
on k mer presence absence for display in heatmaps in extended data fig extreme values of 
similarities were collapsed to be represented by one color extreme values were defined as those 
values more than times the median absolute deviation mad away from the median 
collapsed values were only used for display and not for any statistical tests 

due to the small number of reads in the conservative rna virus dataset we investigated whether 
this depth was enough to obtain a stable representation of the communities we randomly 
selected reads ten times per sample from samples which had at least reads in the 
conservative rna virus dataset we ran mash on these subsamples and calculated the pairwise 
mantel correlations between the resultant dissimilarity matrices all matrices had correlation 
scores of at least r with pearson’s correlation and r with spearman’s correlation

we decided this consistency was sufficiently high to justify confidence in high level patterns 
within this data 

all statistical tests were performed in r v permutation based p values were calculated using 
 permutations multiple test correction was performed where appropriate using the 
benjamini hochberg procedure and adjusted p values reported as q values significance test 
values were considered statistically significant if lower than except where indicated 
otherwise 

the proportion of variability among sample similarities that could be explained by sampling site 
was estimated using npmanova as implemented in the adonis function from the vegan r 
package gene family variability was based on seed subsystem classifications and 
calculated using bray curtis dissimilarities the nmds plots in figure and extended data 
fig were generated using the vegan metamds function with rotation and scaling of 
ordinations performed using the procrustes function and tested for significance using the pro test 
function samples from april and were highly dissimilar and removed from 
figure a to permit the trend in the other samples to be displayed 

synchrony was tested using mantel matrix correlation tests with spearman correlations 
implemented in the vegan r package when testing samples from multiple sites for synchrony 
a partial mantel test was used to control for geographic distance between sampling sites 
environmental data were tested for correlations with microbial community similarities using the 
envfit function if applicable the environmental measures to test were selected based on their 
magnitude and variability in the context of water quality guidelines relationships among 
environmental measures were assessed using spearman’s correlation correlations within and 
among environmental measures and microbial community similarities were displayed in a 
network using the visnetwork r package correlations that had a q value less than were 
considered statistically significant correlations that had a q value greater than but a p value 
less than were not considered statistically significant but were included in visualisations to 
avoid overconfidence in the absence of a relationship however they should be interpreted with 
caution
