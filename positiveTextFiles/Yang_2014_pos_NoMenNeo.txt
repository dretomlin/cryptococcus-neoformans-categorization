the targeted sequencing of taxonomically informative genetic markers sometimes known as metabar 
coding allows eukaryote biodiversity to be measured rapidly cheaply comprehensively repeatedly 
and verifiably metabarcoding helps to remove the taxonomic impediment which refers to the great
logistical difficulties of describing and identifying species and thus promises to improve our ability to
detect and respond to changes in the natural environment now sampling has become a rate limiting
step in biodiversity measurement and in an effort to reduce turnaround time we use arthropod sam 
ples from southern china and vietnam to ask whether soil leaf litter and aboveground samples provide
similar ecological information a soil or leaf litter sample can be collected in minutes whereas an above 
ground sample such as from malaise traps or canopy fogging can require days to set up and run during
which time they are subject to theft damage and deliberate contamination here we show that while
the taxonomic compositions of soil and leaf litter samples are very different from aboveground sam 
etabarcoding
ropical forest
ystematic conservation planning
urveillance monitoring
argeted monitoring

ples both types of samples provide similar ecological information in terms of ranking sites by species
richness and differentiating sites by beta diversity in fact leaf litter samples appear to be as or more pow 
erful than malaise trap and canopy fogging samples at detecting habitat differences we propose that
metabarcoded leaf litter and soil samples be widely tested as a candidate method for rapid environmental
monitoring in terrestrial ecosystems

u et al importantly such collections are auditable because
ites can be sampled by independent parties and analyzed by cer 
ified entities following a standard protocol metabarcode datasets
re also taxonomically more comprehensive many times quicker

 morphologically identified species biodiversity datasets result
n very similar management decisions for monitoring restoration
cology and systematic conservation planning in sum metabar 
oding promises reliable verifiable taxonomically comprehensive 
nd cost effective biodiversity measurement 

despite this promise however considerable work remains
efore metabarcoding can be considered for widespread adoption 

n this paper we focus on a seemingly simple but very useful ques 
ion is it possible to substitute ground level soil or leaf litter 
amples for aboveground samples when conducting biodiversity
urveys ibáñez et al taberlet et al 

an important advantage of a ground level sample is that it can
e cheaply collected in minutes followed by processing in the

ab whereas an aboveground sample such as from canopy fog 
ing or various traps e g malaise flight intercept pitfall light 
nd baited are more expensive and can require days and multi 
le personnel and traps are subject to theft damage vandalism 
nd deliberate contamination for instance we have observed col 
eagues losing malaise traps to elephants and to children leading
o unbalanced sampling effort the need to retrieve aboveground
raps incurs extra field expenses and logistical complications as

result if an environmental certification organization were to
udge say whether a set aside area were truly maintaining bio 
iversity following the potential example of ewers et al 
or oil palm plantations aboveground traps would be problem 
tic because such samples could be deliberately adulterated by
ocal managers newton meijaard sheil in short 
ne shot ground level samples coupled with metabarcoding to
vercome the taxonomic impediment could let us squeeze out
osts and possibilities for fraud in our monitoring data thus accel 
rating environmental measurement 

we have previously designed pipelines to metabarcode arthro 
od biodiversity from aboveground samples yu et al ji
t al and from soil and leaf litter yang et al we
ow use these pipelines to compare soil and leaf litter samples
ith malaise trap samples in southern china meng song and to

ompare leaf litter samples with canopy fogging and morpholog 
cally identified spider samples in central vietnam vu quang and

was chosen for each cluster and the uchime function was used
to perform de novo chimera detection and removal a cluster

are expected to be rare and thus should belong to small clusters

vegan oksanen qiime caporaso et al b and
mvabund warton et al to compare species richness 
we used incidence coverage estimators which were calculated
with vegan’s specpool function the number of reads per otu cor 
relates noisily with otu biomass and abundance amend et al 
 yu et al we thus converted read number to pres 
ence absence using vegan’s decostand function gentleman et al 
 oksanen and we used only otus that had been
assigned to arthropoda as our coi primers were designed for
this phylum to visualize the effects of environmental treatment
levels on community compositions we used principal coordi 
nates analysis pcoa ordination of sørensen dice dissimilarity
matrices faith et al which were created in qiime to
compare pcoa ordinations between datasets we used vegan’s
protest procrustes correlation tests for hypothesis testing we used
mvabund to test the effects of environmental predictors on com 
munity composition mvabund is a multivariate implementation of
generalized linear models and unlike dissimilarity matrix based
methods mvabund does not confound location with dispersion

effects which can inflate type and errors wang et al

ong showing that the metazoan specific s primers still

within the metazoan otus the taxonomic compositions of the

cological information that is do ground level and aboveground
etabarcoded samples differentiate sites and habitat classes in the

ame way

 discussion

we show that metabarcoding technology baird and hajibabaei 
 bik et al ji et al taberlet et al could
ecover biodiversity data from whole collections of arthropods in
amples of soil leaf litter winkler funneled leaf litter malaise
raps and canopy fogging ground level samples from which s
as amplified were dominated by otus assigned to arachnids 

nsects myriapods nematodes and annelids aboveground sam 
les from which coi was amplified were mostly insect otus
table 

we caution that the higher prevalence of nematodes and
nnelids in the ground level samples could reasonably be
ttributed to the different genetic markers used the s primers
ere designed to amplify across the metazoa whereas our coi
rimers are only known to amplify successfully across the arthro 
oda ji et al yu et al our coi primers cannot be
sed to amplify from soil and leaf litter samples because of
eturned otus are bacterial yang et al regardless the tax 
nomic compositions of the metabarcode datasets are consistent
ith the microhabitats from which the samples were collected 

oil and leaf litter microhabitats are indeed highly species rich
n spiders mites centipedes millipedes roundworms and ringed

orms fierer et al ji et al roger estrade et al 
hiele bruhn et al whereas canopy fogging and malaise 
rap samples do capture mostly insects 

 species richness

in meng song soil and leaf litter samples consistently found that
oth forest habitats were more species rich than was the open 

and habitat and malaise trap samples also found the two forest
abitats to be more species rich than is open land but did so less
onsistently 

in vietnam all three sample classes including the spider mor 
hospecies dataset concurred in finding no significant difference

n richness between acacia and protected forest habitats 

 community composition

ground level and aboveground datasets also differentiated
abitats similarly figs and especially in vietnam 

in meng song leaf litter samples significantly differentiated
he two forest habitats from the open land habitat fig a soil
nd malaise trap samples did not do so significantly however 
he significant procrustes correlation between the leaf litter and

alaise trap ordinations fig b suggests that malaise trap data
re just less statistically powerful for differentiating these habi 
ats in other words the discrepancy between the procrustes and
vabund analyses is due to the different questions asked in pro 

rustes tests we ask only if community compositions vary in the
ame way across samples in mvabund tests we ask if an exoge 
ous environmental predictor variable can explain some of that
ariance also unlike standard community analyses that are based

n distance matrices mvabund avoids ascribing significant effects
o environmental variables simply due to heteroscedasticity in the
ataset warton et al meaning that mvabund tends to be
onservative in this respect 

ong china malaise traps vs soil samples c vu quang and bach ma vietnam canopy
morphology samples e vu quang vietnam leaf litter vs spider morphology sample
tors – 

in vietnam the leaf litter and canopy fogging samples both
exhibited the same location x habitat interaction effect separating
the two locations of bach ma and vu quang and also separating aca 
cia from protected forest habitats in bach ma only figs b and c 
the spider morphospecies dataset concurred with the metabarcode
datasets in finding no significant difference between habitats in vu
quang fig b this appears to be a reasonable result because the
acacia forests in vu quang are small plots see section embedded
within a much larger natural forest habitat so we expect con 
siderable dispersal of arthropods between acacia and protected
forest habitats in vu quang ‘spillover ’ koh lucey and hill 
 dispersal might also explain the lack of difference in species
richness between habitats fig b even though tropical tree plan 
tations generally are known to support low species richness lugo 
 in contrast in bach ma the acacia plantations are ∼ – 
times larger than those in vu quang and we should therefore
expect more habitat differentiation as we observed fig b 

 potential advantages of leaf litter as an environmental
indicator

our meng song results suggest that leaf litter might be more
ecologically informative than soil and malaise trap samples since
leaf litter samples more consistently showed that the two forest
habitats are more species rich and are compositionally different
from open land habitats figs a and a we speculate that the
malaise trap samples did not differentiate forest from open land
habitats because flying arthropods move more easily between the
two koh lucey and hill in vietnam the leaf litter
samples matched the canopy fogging samples in detecting the
habitat × location interaction effect figs b and c 

it is possible that leaf litter samples being at the interface of
belowground and aboveground communities end up integrating
ecological information from both to date the leaf litter micro 
habitat has posed a severe taxonomic impediment graça 
henderson and walker but metabarcoding technology
could unlock this information our results also show that using
winkler and we presume berlese funnels to filter leaf litter sam 
ples will result in a greater proportion of metazoan otus when
metabarcoding table a vs b whether this additional processing
is worth the extra time and cost depends on particular situations 

finally an important advantage of a ground level sample is that
it can be cheaply collected in minutes followed by processing in
the lab whereas an aboveground sample can require multiple col 
lection days leaving traps subject to theft damage vandalism and
deliberate contamination alternatively if canopy fogging is used 
costs are higher 

as for processing costs ji et al estimated a cost range
of us – per sample for metabarcode samples using the
roche gs flx ‘ ’ sequencer illumina sequencers are consider 
ably cheaper to run and can now produce full bp coi barcodes
 liu et al so future costs are likely to be near the low end
of that range plus a profit margin should this technology even 
tually become commercially available as for processing times ji
et al found that the “active workload” lab computer 
facing work of metabarcoding was approximately one quarter that
of visually sorting indicator taxa to morphospecies where the taxa
ranged from moths to carabid beetles to spiders to ants for the

microscopic taxa typical of ground level samples table the time
advantage of metabarcoding is certainly many times greater 

however note that the increased detection power of
metabarcoding requires greater efforts to guard against sample

 conclusions

our study tested the hypothesis that metabarcoding will allow
round level samples to substitute for aboveground samples when
haracterizing biodiversity patterns pulleman et al the
esult is that although the two classes of metabarcode data 
round level and aboveground were composed of very different
axa we still found that these two classes of data returned simi 
ar ecological information that is ground level and aboveground

etabarcoded samples differentiated sites and habitat classes in
he same way and therefore to answer our motivating ques 
ion it could indeed be possible to substitute ground level soil
r leaf litter samples for aboveground samples when conducting
iodiversity surveys making large efficiency gains possible at the
ampling stage 

all sampling methods have their own biases and noise and there
xists no ‘true’ biodiversity dataset to test against we can only
ompare different methods and look for statistical concord 
nce and similar policy conclusions in this study we tested
or statistical concordance what is needed now are case studies
n which ground level and aboveground samples are compared for
heir policy level conclusions ji et al for instance do the
wo sample types produce similar systematic conservation plans 
etect similar community trends after a restoration treatment or
ther environmental change and or return similar results when
esting basic ecological hypotheses as an example using only
boveground samples edwards et al compared the indica 
or performance of metabarcoded malaise trap samples and taxon
ubsets thereof with conventionally identified datasets of birds 
cavenging mammals dung beetles and leaf litter ants seven sub 
ets birds leaf litter ants dung beetles plus metabarcoded beetles 
ymenoptera flies and true bugs proved to be consistently good
redictors of the response of the other taxa to logging and oil palm 

n that they made similar recommendations for how to optimally
rotect species richness across a matrix of logged and unlogged
ropical forest 

more generally our results and the many others that are rapidly
ccumulating in the metabarcoding literature reviews in baird and
ajibabaei bik et al bohmann et al 
alvignac spencer et al ji et al taberlet et al 
uggest that metabarcoding shows great promise in allowing us to
ove away from indicator taxa and toward the measurement of

otal biodiversity thereby improving our ability to track and man 
ge the natural environment breure et al dolman et al 
 edwards et al lindenmayer and likens newton 
 nicholson et al using convenient taxonomic subsets
an lead to inflated or out of date estimates of the biodiversity
alue of particular habitats if the taxa used are wide ranging or have
ong generation times and thus respond slowly to environmental
hange reviewed in edwards et al 

high efficiency in biodiversity surveys is a fundamental require 
ent if ecosystems are to be managed over the spatial scale of

andscapes meaning thousands to tens of thousands of square kilo 
eters at a time this is to help achieve policy additionality e g 

orest protection in one site does not merely lead to deforestation
n a neighboring site to cover large scale processes such as migra 

ion and the emergent effects of landscape complexity and simply
ecause it is more efficient to be sure it is remote sensing technol 
gy that will be the primary mode by which large scale monitoring
ill be achieved but efficient sampling techniques combined with
tors – 

metabarcoding will be needed to interpret the high volume of
earth observation data that is anticipated lynch et al
