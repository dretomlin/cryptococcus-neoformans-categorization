changes in plant cover after afforestation induce variations in litter inputs and soil microbial community
structure and activity which may promote the accrual and physical chemical protection of soil organic
carbon soc within soil aggregates in a long term experiment years we have studied the effects on
soil aggregation and soc stabilization of two afforestation techniques a amended terraces with organic
refuse at and b terraces without organic amendment t we used the adjacent shrubland s as
control twenty years after stand establishment aggregate distribution including microaggregates
within larger aggregates sensitive and slow organic carbon oc fractions basal respiration in macro 
aggregates and microbial community structure were measured the main changes occurred in the top
layer e cm where i both the sensitive and slow oc fractions were increased in at compared to s
and t ii the percentage and oc content of microaggregates within macroaggregates mm were higher
in at than in s and t iii basal respiration in macroaggregates was also higher in at and iv significant
changes in the fungal rather than bacterial community structure were observed in the afforested soils
 at and t e compared to the shrubland soil these results suggest that the increase in oc pools linked to
the changes in microbial activity and fungal community structure after afforestation promoted the
formation of macroaggregates e which acted as the nucleus for the formation and stabilization of oc

a major source of labile organic c for microbial activity fostering
the binding of clay and silt size particles and the formation of
microaggregates within macroaggregates increasing the stability
of soil aggregates jastrow six et al a in addition to the
substantial role of labile organic matter inputs many studies have
pointed out the important function of soil microorganisms in the
formation and stabilization of soil aggregates díaz et al 
siddiky et al the microorganisms act in two ways a 
fungal hyphae favor the mechanical union of soil particles and b 
the exudation of byproducts promotes the coalescence of primary
particles de gryze et al helfrich et al generally 
fungi are thought to be more important in soil aggregate formation
than bacteria de gryze et al this has led to the suggestion
that manipulations to enhance c sequestration should include
shifting the soil microbial community towards an increased fungal
component jastrow et al in this sense the change of mi 
crobial structure or the introduction of microorganisms into the
soil with lasting effects is very difficult to tackle with current
technologies jastrow et al a possible option could be to
cause changes in the vegetation cover through afforestation since
the vegetation type can influence the microbial community struc 
ture costa et al afforestation is a key land use change
across the world and is considered to be a dominant factor con 
trolling ecosystems functioning and biodiversity however the
response of soil microbial communities to this change is not well
understood macdonald et al here we intend to increase
our knowledge of this response by using next generation
sequencing techniques to provide a detailed analysis of the struc 
ture diversity and taxonomic composition of both the bacterial
and fungal communities in natural shrubland and afforested soil
under semiarid conditions 

in a previous publication from the same experimental area 
garcia franco et al showed that based on results obtained
 years after the plantation of trees the afforestation of semiarid
shrublands may result in either sequestration or loss of organic c in
the ecosystem depending on the site preparation technique used 
so after years the afforestationwith soil organic amendment led
to an increase of kg c m� in the ecosystem while without soil
amendment a decrease of kg c m� occurred here we inves 
tigate the mechanisms of the processes defining the accrual and
stabilization of soc in afforested semiarid soils based on the earlier
results we hypothesized that the plantation of pinus halepensis
would increase fresh litter inputs into the soil leading to 
changes in soil organic c fractions which can related to soil organic
c pools with different turnover rates changes in soil aggregate 
size distribution due to the formation of new macroaggregates and
organic c enriched microaggregates within macroaggregates 
increase in basal respiration within the macroaggregates as an in 
dicator of higher microbial activity which might be related with
organic c protection in microaggregates formed within macroag 
gregates changes in the microbial populations structure due to
the increase in ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with p halepensis 
which can produce aggregate stabilizing mycelia and a close
correlation between these changes in soil aggregation and micro 
bial structure and activity in our hypothesis we are assuming a 
the oc accrual in microaggregates within macroaggregates is
considered as an indicator of soil c stabilization and long term
sequestration six et al and b the separated soil organic
c fractions arising from the fractionation procedure used corre 
spond to the sensitive and slow pools of roth c zimmermann et al 
 

this long term experiment was performed under environ 
mental conditions typical of mediterranean semiarid areas so the
results could be extrapolated to extensive areas of land around the
world the specific objectives of this study were to analyze the
effects of the afforestation of degraded shrublands on changes
in soil aggregation changes in the soil microbial community

 material and methods

 site description and experimental design

the study area was located in the sierra de carrascoy murcia 
southeast spain � n � w m a s l the climate is
semiarid with an average annual precipitation of mm and a
mean annual temperature of �c the mean annual potential
evapotranspiration is e mm y� the soils are classified as
haplic calcaric leptosolwith inclusions of haplic calcisols and leptic
calcisols fao the lithology is constituted by hard and
compact limestone rocks the fertility of the soils after each treat 
ment is showed in table the dominant vegetation is composed of
species typical of mediterranean shrublands such as rosmarinus
officinalis l thymus vulgaris l and anthyllis cytisoides l with
scattered p halepensis miller 

the experiment site was established in october in an area
of m and consisted of three m � m plots located on an
east facing hillside mean slope to test the following affor 
estation techniques a mechanical terracing with a single appli 
cation of kg m� of an organic amendment which consisted of
the organic waste of urban soil refuse usr garcía et al and
p halepensis plantation plot at and b mechanical terracing and
p halepensis plantation without organic amendment plot t 
addition to test these afforestation techniques an adjacent medi 
terranean shrubland was considered as the control plot s more
details about these afforestation techniques are given in garcia 
franco et al 

 soil sampling design

in april years after afforestation a randomized soil
sampling trial was designed to assess the effects of the tested fac 
tors six m � m soil sampling sub plots were selected at each
plot sampling sites the separation between sampling sites was
about m in one direction and m in the other the sampling
sites were located under trees in treatments at and t and under
shrubs in the control s at each sampling site soil samples were
collected from three soil depths e cm e cm and e cm



n garcia franco et al soil biology biochemistry e 
 sampling points for the whole experiment at each sampling
point soil samples were randomly collected as a composite of three
subsamples soil dna extractions aimed at analyzing the com 
munity structure of soil bacteria and fungi were performed in
composite surface samples e cm collected in three sampling
sites per treatment

 soil organic c fractionation procedure
to test the changes in soc fractions with different turnover rates

 hypothesis the organic fractions were separated with a com 
bined physical and chemical method according to zimmermann
et al thirty grams of soil mm were added to
 ml of water and dispersed using a calibrated ultrasonic probe 
type with an output energy of j ml� application of more en 
ergy may disrupt the coarse sand sized som amelung and zech 
 the dispersed suspension was then wet sieved over a 
mm aperture sieve until the rinsing water was clear the fraction
 mm containing the sand fraction and stable aggregates s þ a 
together with particulate organic matter pom was dried at �c
and weighed the suspension mm was filtered through a 
mm aperture nylon mesh and the material mm was dried at
 �c and weighed the pom was separated by stirring the fraction
 mmwith sodium polytungstate at a density of g cm� cerli
et al themixturewas centrifuged at � g for min and
the light fraction was decanted both fractions were washed with
deionized water to remove all the sodium polytungstate dried at
 �c and weighed the oc concentrations were determined in
every fraction using an elemental analyzer leco truspec cn 
michigan usa the samples were analyzed in triplicate the oc
content for each fraction was calculated with the following

in this study we have processed the soc fractions in two main
groups according to their turnover rates i a sensitive fraction
 ocs formed by the free particulate organic matter which corre 
spond to the light fraction separated by stirring the fraction mm
with sodium polytungstate at a density of g cm� and ii a slow
fraction ocsw constituted by the oc stabilized in aggregates
 heavy fraction mm combinedwith the oc associatedwith clay
and silt mm fraction the separation of these two groups was
based in the study of zimmermann et al in which a strong
correlation was found between the separate soc fractions sepa 
rated with the above procedure and the sensitive and slow soc
pools used in roth c 

 characterization of the ocs fraction the molecular compo 
sition of the ocs fraction at e cm depth was determined by c 
nmr spectroscopic analysis using a varian unity spectrometer 
samples were filled into zirconium dioxide rotors mm diameter 
and spun in a magic angle spinning probe at a rotation speed of
 khz to minimize chemical anisotropy a ramped h pulse was
used during a contact time of ms to prevent hartmann hahn
mismatches the contact time was ms for each sample 
 runing was carried out before the final spectrum for inte 
gration chemical shift regions were used as follows i aliphatic or
alkyl c e ppm of lipids fatty acids and plant aliphatic poly 
mers ii o alkyl c e ppm deriving primarily from poly 
saccharides cellulose and hemicelluloses but also from proteins
and side chains of lignin iii aromatic or aryl c e ppm 
deriving from lignin and or protein and finally iv carbonyl c
 e ppm from aliphatic esters carboxyl groups and amide
carbonyls integration of the peaks within each of the chemical shift
regions allowed estimation of the relative c contents expressed as
percentages of the total area helfrich et al 

 soil aggregate size distribution
to test the changes in soil aggregate size distribution due to the

formation of new macroaggregates and organic c enriched micro 
aggregates within macroaggregates hypothesis aggregate size
separation was performed by the wet sieving method of elliott
 briefly g of air dried mm sieved soil were placed
on top of a mm sieve and submerged for min in deionized
water at room temperature the sieving was performed manually
by moving the sieve up and down cm times for min e to
achieve aggregate separation a series of three sieves 
and mm was used to obtain four aggregate fractions i 
 mm large macroaggregates lm ii e mm small 
macroaggregates sm iii e mm microaggregates m and
iv mm silt plus clay size particles s þ c the aggregate size
classes were oven dried �c weighed and stored in glass jars
at room temperature �c sand correction was performed for
each aggregate size class because sand was not considered to be
part of the aggregates elliott et al 

microaggregates contained within both the large and small 
macroaggregates lmm and smm respectively were mechani 
cally isolated according to the methodology described by six et al 
 b and denef et al briefly a g macroaggregate
subsample was immersed in deionized water on top of a mm
mesh screen inside a cylinder the macroaggregates were shaken
together with glass beads mm diameter until complete
macroaggregate disruption was observed once the macroaggre 
gates had been broken up microaggregates and other mm
material passed through the mesh screen with the help of a
continuous water flow the material retained on the mm sieve
was wet sieved to ensure that isolated microaggregates were water
stable six et al b the oc determination was performed
separately for all aggregate size classes using an elemental
analyzer leco truspec cn michigan usa

 changes in soil aggregation

twenty years after the afforestation the percentage of water 
stable aggregates differed significantly across the treatments areas
afforested with p halepensis and receiving no organic amendments
 t showed the lowest percentages of large and small 
macroaggregates suggesting mechanical disturbance of the soil
structure owing to the terracing works this initial impact was fol 
lowed by an active process of new macroaggregates formation
 mm in the organically amended afforested soils at which
behaved similarly to the shrubland soils e particularly in the topsoil
layers this suggests that theorganic amendmentsoffset thenegative
impact of the terraces similar soil structure deterioration following
mechanical terracing was described by other authors barber and
romero likewise other studies reported increases in soil
aggregation due to both soil afforestation caravaca et al 
khale et al and soil organic amendment díaz et al 

afforestation and amendment treatment at increased not
only the percentage of macroaggregates mm but also the
percentage of microaggregates occluded inside the macroaggre 
gates in addition the oc concentration in these new micro 
aggregates formed in at soil was higher than in the non occluded
microaggregates existing in the soil before afforestation as was
hypothesized above overall these results suggest a hierarchical
order of aggregation in at in which macroaggregates were the
nucleus for microaggregate formation in the center of macroag 
gregates oades similar to previously described models of
soil aggregation see six et al for a review we suggest that
in a first stage following afforestation the organic amendment
quickly induced the formation of macroaggregates due to a an
increase in microbial activity and b inputs of binding agents like
polysaccharides díaz et al golchin et al over time 
this initial effect of the organic amendment was gradually main 
tained by fresh plant material entering the soil derived from the
growth of the planted vegetation see discussion below in a sec 
ond stage inside these macroaggregates the presence of decom 
posed organic matter metabolites and biogenic products 
polyvalent cations and other binding agents promoted the solid 
phase reaction between organic matter and clay and silt particles
e leading to the formation of stable microaggregates edwards and
bremner golchin et al in treatment t the soil con 
ditions e very low soil organic matter little microbial activity and
few biomass inputs e were totally unfavorable for aggregates for 
mation and the process unfolded very slowly 

 factors controlling changes in soil aggregation

in order to know the relative contribution of each factor to the
soil aggregation and the carbon stabilization and sequestration



n garcia franco et al soil biology biochemistry e 
capacity in the afforested areas we analyzed the changes which
occurred after each treatment 

 quality and amount of soil organic inputs
organic amendments significantly increased the percentage of

stable aggregates in the first years following the at treatment
 querejeta et al similar results have been reported world 
wide bartoli et al clark et al and specifically under
the same environmental conditions and with the same organic
amendments as ours roldan et al it is worth mentioning 
however that not all organic amendments have the same effect on
soil aggregation clark et al the ability to promote the
formation of new macroaggregates depends on a the content of
transient binding agents such as polysaccharides or fresh plant
material and b the amounts of microbially available c that can
promote fungal proliferation lucas et al in this experiment 
the organic amendment had a high content of carbohydrates see
querejeta et al it is likely that this was a key factor in the
initial stages of macroaggregate formation due to its double action
as a binding agent and as a stimulating microbial resource 

several studies have shown that the effects of soil organic
amendments are temporary mainly appearing in the first week
after addition debosz et al clark et al this is
attributed to the rapid turnover of labile organic pools as díaz et al 
 reported for polysaccharides in this study afforestation plus
a single initial amendment at led to an increase in the soil ocs
and ocsw fractions while afforestation without organic matter
addition did not increase the ocs fraction and led to a reduction of
ocsw compared to the shrubland these changes probably are a
response to the higher biomass production and thus litter inputs 
in at compared to the other treatments garcia franco et al 
other authors obtained similar results after afforestation on
abandoned agricultural soils lagani�ere et al wei et al 
 in this way the initial effects of the organic amendment
on soil aggregation continued for treatment at due to the increases
in oc fractions 

besides quantitative changes in oc fractions the quality of ocs
plays an important role in soil aggregation and c sequestration
 steffens et al we found that the composition of ocs in
afforested soils showed an increase in o alkyl c such as that found
in carbohydrates with respect to the shrubland soil the o alkyl c
compounds are considered as indicators of the amount of organic
binding agents which improvemacroaggregate formation degens 
 several authors showed that carbohydrates were signifi 
cantly correlated with aggregate stability martens and
frankenberger our results agree with those of steffens
et al who found greater aggregate stability to be associ 
ated with large contributions of o alkyl c from the labile fraction of
soil organic matter 

altogether our results suggest that the increase of the soc
fractions mainly ocs and the higher carbohydrates concentration
in these fraction after afforestation plus organic amendment led to
an increase of the soil carbon sequestration capacity induced by
new aggregates formation an important proportion of this oc
came from microaggregates enriched in oc and occluded within
macroaggregates e as can be deduced from the positive correlation
between this occluded oc and both oc fractions especially ocs
 table other authors also obtained positive correlations be 
tween labile c fractions and macroaggregates bhattacharyya et al 
 

 changes in microbial activity and structure
with regard to the implications of the microbial community for

soil aggregate formation and c sequestration we must discuss two
aspects a microbial activity hypothesis and b community
structure hypothesis basal respiration an estimate of the total
microbial activity in soils vanhala et al was significantly
higher in macroaggregates of afforested soils receiving amend 
ments at compared to the other treatments afforestation per 
formed without amendments t however led to a lower
macroaggregates basal respiration than in the shrubland similarly 
in the literature the responses of microbial activity to afforestation
are various several studies showed decreases in microbial activity
in afforested areas goberna et al chen et al in
contrast other authors reported increases inmicrobial activity after
afforestation mao and zeng this apparent discrepancy is
mainly due to the previous use and characteristics of the soils the
afforestation method or the stand age 

the tight correlations between basal respiration in macroag 
gregates and the percentage of macroaggregates mm in all
treatments suggest that this microbial activity could be an impor 
tant factor in the new macroaggregates formation in accordance
with these results many studies have indicated the key role of
microbial populations in soil aggregate formation siddiky et al 
 daynes et al however the correlations between
basal respiration in macroaggregates with the percentage of micro 
within macroaggregates br mm and basal respiration with oc
associated to micro within macroaggregates br ocmm showed
very different behavior between the native shrubland and the
afforested soils with respect to aggregation processes and c
sequestration the strong positive correlations between br mm
and br ocmm in soils at and t suggest an active microbial 
induced process of microaggregates formation inside larger ag 
gregates e much more active in at as discussed above e which
protects the oc associated with these microaggregates increasing
its turnover time and leading to present c sequestration in the
afforested ecosystems 

these changes in som turnover induced by easily available c
inputs are widely known as the priming effect blagodatsky et al 
 as a result of priming the decomposition of som by soil
microbes is stimulated by the supply of fresh c as a source of energy
 fontaine et al van groenigen et al paradoxically in
this study the increase in microbial activity in the macroaggregates
led to an increase in c sequestration potential this indicates that
the som dynamic in the macroaggregates is controlled at least in
part by microbial populations e as has been shown by other au 
thors baumann et al two mechanisms have been sug 
gested to explain how this priming effect leads to c sequestration i 
the existence of a bank mechanism that regulates nutrients and c
sequestration in soil priming effect is low when nutrient avail 
ability is high allowing sequestration of nutrients and carbon in
contrast microbes release nutrients from som when nutrient
availability is low fontaine et al and ii the microbial
efficiency matrix stabilization which integrates plant litter
decomposition with som stabilization labile plants constituents
are the dominant source of microbial products these microbial
products of decompositionwould thus become themain precursors
of stable som by promoting aggregation and through strong
chemical bonding to the mineral matrix cotrufo et al 

our results in agreement with both mechanisms may
contribute to a more detailed knowledge of som stabilization
pathways in macroaggregates of semiarid forest ecosystems the
bank mechanism can be corroborated by the comparison of
nutrient availability and som accumulation between the at and s
treatments table due to the high nutrient availability the
stimulation of som decomposition priming effect in at was low 
allowing c sequestration in addition the increase in ocs in soil at
was a dominant source for microbial products of decomposition
and fungal hyphae these were the main precursors of som stabi 
lization through promotion of macroaggregates formation inside



n garcia franco et al soil biology biochemistry e 
these macroaggragates the strong chemical bonding between
organic matter and mineral soil particles led to stable micro 
aggregates formation which was favored by the clay mineralogy
and abundance of ca þ in the soil matrix 

therefore our results suggest a pathway for the physical 
chemical protection of som and c sequestration through the for 
mation of oc enriched microaggregates occluded in macroaggre 
gates fig we hypothesize that this is a self protection system
developed by the soil inside the macroaggregates to offset the
potential effect on som decomposition induced by the increase of
microbial activity this process was activated in the soil following
the increase in the inputs of fresh plant residues after afforestation
with the at treatment our results seem to confirm the hypothesis
 and show the importance of microbial activity enhancement in
the afforestation methodologies employed in semiarid areas with
the purpose of c sequestration 

by contrast in the shrubland a negative correlation between
basal respiration in macroaggregates and the percentage of micro
within macroaggregates was found this suggests that an aggre 
gates breakdown process occurred promoted by the microbial ac 
tivity the degree of conservation or loss of resources such as soil
nutrients is considered to be crucial in dryland ecosystem dynamic
 scanlon et al we hypothesized that this process was
induced by a bank mechanism due to the reduction of fresh litter
inputs because of degradation of shrubs by external stresses
 mayor et al soil nutrient availability decreased bautista
et al e promoting microbial decomposition of stable som
and organo mineral bonds which led to aggregates disruption 
therefore we consider that the key factor e for the activation of
either the self protection organic carbon system or the aggregate
disruption model ewas the input of plant litter into the soil as this
regulates the soil food web fig 
fig diagram showing the soil organic carbon dynamic in i semiarid areas with a well
degraded pathway 
in addition these results suggest that the correlations between
the microbial activity in macroaggregates measured as basal
respiration and the percentage of microaggregates within mac 
roaggregates and the oc concentration in microaggregates within
macroaggregates could be valid indicators of soc gains or losses 
positive correlations indicate soil c sequestration and negative
correlations indicate soil c emission processes the advantage of
these indicators is that the measurement at a point in time allows
the determination of the trend of a dynamic process not needing
long time periods to establish the soil c dynamic in the ecosystem 
evidently further research under different environmental condi 
tions is needed to validate this hypothesis 

the afforestation treatments mainly at led to long term shifts
in the fungal community structure diversity and relative abun 
dance of several major fungal taxa compared to the reference
shrubland however the soil bacterial communities were not so
sensitive to afforestation the changes in the fungal community
structure seem to have been mediated mainly by the shifts in the
plant cover due to the afforestationwith pine trees as suggested by
the increase in the relative abundance of agaricomycotina this
taxon includes ectomycorrhizal fungi that are associated with p 
halepensis roldan and albaladejo this is in agreement with
previous studies which reported that bacterial communities pri 
marily respond to changes in the physical chemical characteristics
of the substrate while fungal communities are more sensitive to
land uses changes ros et al macdonald et al 

in our study the distribution of aggregate size classes correlated
significantly with the community structure of the soil fungi but not
with that of the soil bacteria this agrees with previous surveys that
attributed a stronger influence on soil aggregation to fungi relative
to bacteria de gryze et al zhang et al particularly 
members of the agaromycotina have been reported to produce
 preserved vegetation pathway and ii semiarid areas which vegetation has been



n garcia franco et al soil biology biochemistry e 
considerable amounts of aggregate stabilizing mycelia caravaca
et al we also detected that the fungal but not the bacte 
rial community structure was significantly associated with the
basal respiration measured in the macroaggregates this agrees
with the notion that fungi metabolize low quality substrates more
efficiently six et al than bacteria do holland and coleman 
 griffith and bardgett 

facedwith the question “were the changes in fungal community
structure after afforestation involved in the promotion of soil ag 
gregation ” our findings suggest an affirmative response we
found the following changes in afforested areas in comparison to
shrubland an increase in agaromycotina e a fungal group which
can produce considerable amounts of aggregates stabilizing
mycelium caravaca et al a decrease in chry 
tridiomycota e a unicellular fungus unable to produce mycelia and
 an increase in species richness we think that these changes
increased the amount and diversity of biotic bonding agents and
fostered the formation of macroaggregates this affirmationmay be
supported by the significant correlations found between the fungal
community structure and aggregate size distribution and between
the fungal community structure and basal respiration in macro 
aggregates at the surface layer in all the treatments tested 

 conclusions

qualitative and quantitative changes in oc fractions linked to
the shifts in microbial activity within macroaggregates and fungal
community structure after afforestation performed with an initial
organic amendment promoted the formation of macroaggregates
occluding and protecting oc rich microaggregates inside the
accrual and physical chemical stabilization of oc in this hierar 
chical structure is a key aspect with respect to increasing or
maintaining soil c stocks overall our results revealed that land use
changes involving increases in sensitive oc fractions and 
fungal populations capable of producing large amount of mycelia 
are suitable to prevent and mitigate the negative impacts of cli 
matic change on soil quality 

in addition we suggest that the correlations between the basal
respiration in macroaggregates and percentage of microaggregates
withinmacroaggregates could be an indicator of the organic carbon
dynamic in the soil further research is needed to validate this
indicator
