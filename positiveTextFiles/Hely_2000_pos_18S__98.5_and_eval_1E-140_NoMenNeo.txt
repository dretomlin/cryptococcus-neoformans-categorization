coarse woody debris in the southeastern
canadian boreal forest composition and load
variations in relation to stand replacement

c hély y bergeron and m d flannigan

abstract quantities and structural characteristics of coarse woody debris cwd logs and snags were examined in
relation to stand age and composition in the canadian mixedwood boreal forest forty eight stands originating after fire
 from to years were sampled on mesic clay deposits the point centered quadrant method was used to record
canopy composition and structure living trees and snags the line intersect method was used to sample logs of all di 
ameters total log load mean snag density and volume per stand were similar to other boreal stands linear and non 
linear regressions showed that time since fire and canopy composition were significant descriptors for log load
changes whereas time since fire was the only significant factor for snag changes coarse woody debris accumulation
models through time since fire were different from the u shaped model because the first initial decrease from residual
pre disturbance debris was missing the involved species had rapid decay rates with no long term accumulation and the
succession occurred from species replacement through time

coarse woody debris cwd as standing dead trees
 snags and fallen boles and branches logs contribute to
the structure microhabitat diversity and nutrient cycling of

and best the functional importance of cwd depends
not only on their quantities but also on their size distribu 
tion degree of decay species position snags vs logs and
spatial arrangement harmon et al insight into the
dynamics of cwd will guide managers in understanding the
impacts of current management regimes on the cwd cycle
and their consequences on biodiversity stand health and
ecosystem productivity harmon et al keddy and

the availability of cwd in early stages of forest develop

debris then declines over time while there is a gradual addi 
tional input from the regenerating stand as stands mature 
tree mortality increases and contributes to the cwd reser 
voir debris levels usually peak during a transitional stage as
the even aged stand senesces into a more uneven aged struc 
ture finally levels decline resulting in the reverse j shaped
diameter distribution of uneven aged forests harmon et al 
 spies et al 

in the canadian mixedwood boreal forest the forest vege 
tation is characterized by a gradual change in canopy species
dominance following major disturbances such as fires
 bergeron and dubuc payette roussopoulos
 all tree species regenerate within a few years follow 
ing the fire but the different growth rates create a successive
dominance in the canopy from shade intolerant deciduous
species to shade tolerant coniferous species paré and
bergeron have shown that the species replacement
and the occurrence of spruce budworm outbreaks affect the
aboveground biomass as trees are the cwd producers it
would be interesting to see if cwd accumulation through
time follows the same pattern as compared with the above 
ground biomass our objectives in this study were twofold 
first we wanted to document the cwd quantities species
composition and distributions to determine the appropriate
cwd accumulation models for the canadian mixedwood
boreal forest secondly we wanted to test the effect of stand
composition and time since fire as potential factors that
could simultaneously influence changes in cwd compo 
nents our hypothesis is that in the southeastern canadian
boreal forest temporal patterns will differ from the tradi 
tional u shaped model because there is a species replace 
ment with time and the involved species produce different
cwd loads that have rapid but different decay rates

data collection

sampling design
forty eight stands initiated after lethal fires dating from to

 years ago were selected on gently sloping mesic clay deposits 
time of stand initiation has been determined in previous dendro 
chronological studies bergeron dansereau and bergeron
 each stand was sampled with a m sided equilateral trian 
gle mcrae et al the triangular layout was used to mini 

mize bias in situations where logs are not randomly oriented and to
cover the variation in cwd distribution van wagner this
delineated sampling area was used to evaluate cwd composition
and loads and to analyze the living canopy composition appendix 

canopy composition
we sampled canopy characteristics tree species diameter at

breast height dbh total height of trees and status in the canopy
as dominant or subdominant tree using the point centered quad 
rant method mueller dombois and ellenberg mcrae et al 
 six points were set up along triangle edges and trees
were recorded per stand dominant trees and sub dominant
trees the distances between trees and the quadrant centers
were measured to calculate densities and basal areas per stand and
per species mcrae et al 

coarse woody debris
in the analyses logs represent boles and branches while snags

represent standing dead trees the line intersect method van wag 
ner was used along each triangle side to sample logs 
all surficial woody pieces crossing the line were recorded in six
diameter size classes pieces less than cm in diameter were re 
corded within the five classes recommended by mcrae et al 
 using different intersect line lengths for each diameter
class class i – cm on a m long line class ii – cm
on a m line class iii – cm on a m line class iv –
 cm on a m line class v – cm on a m line for
these classes total number of woody pieces and species propor 
tions were measured appendices and 

we recorded the species and diameter size to the nearest
 cm of each item greater than cm in diameter these large
logs constitute the sixth class we did not use decay classes be 
cause only logs on the litter upper duff logs were measured and
few showed different decay states moreover the moss cover was
very infrequent in all stands as reported previously by de
grandpré et al the equation to calculate corrected fuel

to compute the cedar log loads per diameter size class both on 
tario and minnesota are the nearest geographically and ecologi 
cally relevant data sources for our study area 

snags were sampled within six m radius circles centered on
the point centered quadrants snag species height and diameter at
the top were recorded dbh if taller than m densities basal
areas and volumes of snags were calculated but decay class was
not recorded as all snags were into an intermediate decay class that
no longer had bark 

analyses

canonical correspondence analysis
canonical correspondence analysis cca ter braak –

 was used to analyze the distribution of the stands accord 
ing to species log loads and species snag basal areas basal area of
living trees dominant and subdominant trees are the active de 
scriptive variables while time since fire was included in the analy 
sis as a passive variable jongman et al to evaluate the
degree of association between this variable and the two first canon 
ical axes further monte carlo permutation tests ter braak –
 were performed on the two first canonical axes to investi 
gate the statistical significance of the impact variables on axes 

covariance analysis
the pathway types found in the cca have been analyzed

through a covariance analysis sas institute inc this anal 
ysis was conducted on total log loads with time since fire as the
continuous variable and the pathway type birch or aspen as clas 
sification variable because a positive effect for both variables was
found the covariance analysis was extended to all cwd compo 
nents the year old coniferous stands were not included as
they were the same for both pathways 

effect of time since the last fire
nonlinear regressions sas institute inc were computed

to study the potential effect of time since fire on log loads total
per stand per diameter size classes and per species and on snag
volumes total per stand and per species 

effects of time since the last fire and stand composition
we used multiple linear regression with the forward stepwise

procedure sas institute inc to test the significant effect of
time since fire and basal areas of living tree species on log and
snag components for each species we distinguished two canopy
layers ba and ba for basal area of dominant and dominated trees 
respectively this partitioning of the living basal areas is used to
represent the canopy composition and its variability if time is the
only significant descriptor it will then correspond to the real
change in cwd accumulation with time conversely if living
basal areas are also descriptors of cwd accumulation changes 
then changes are the result of canopy composition changes through
the successional process

shows the descriptive basal areas with time since fire as pas 
sive variable fig on the main graph birch and aspen
stands are segregated according to the first axis and they
present two successional pathways the two arrow direc 
tions these two patterns converge at the end of the succes 
sion after years since fire towards coniferous stands 
the upper graph shows that all trembling aspen tall white
birch and white cedar are the best represented variables de 
fining the two axes these living basal areas are well corre 
lated with both the basal area of snags and the log loads of
their respective species see scores in table finally time
since fire is well correlated with canonical axes table 
and it is related positively with the dominating coniferous
basal areas and negatively with the trembling aspen basal ar 
eas and the subdominant conifer basal areas 

the covariance analysis on total log load fig shows
that birch and aspen stands have the same slope parameter
but significantly different intercepts log loads in birch
stands tend to be heavier than in aspen stands this analysis
supports the existence of two successional pathways shown
by the cca however covariance analyses carried out on
each cwd component showed that time since fire was the
most significant factor not shown for these reasons we
have chosen to only consider time since fire as a significant
factor and we have analyzed the stands together 

effects of time since the last fire
the first five diameter size classes of logs present the

same general trend in relation to time since fire fig 
with a u shaped curve prolonged by a plateau or a decrease
in the very late successional stages all these fine debris lev 
els tend to be variable but quite high years following the
fire log loads decrease with stand age to a low at – 
years an accumulation period follows then for a year
period and then plateaus or decreases again at late stages 
however the cumulative five class loads represent on aver 
age ± mean ± sd of total log load the class vi
load presents a significantly different pattern through time
since fire fig coarse debris levels are the lowest 

years after fire but they increase up to years in stands
older than years log loads tend to slightly decrease be 
fore increasing again in the late stages these two different
patterns among log class loads associated to the proportions
of fine and coarse debris loads imply that total log loads
 fig fit a different pattern from the above ones with a
general load increasing with time among the species only
balsam fir and trembling aspen log loads had significant
trends through time fig aspen log loads decreased with
time whereas fir log loads increased through time white
birch log loads remained high over the entire period while
white spruce log loads were consistently the lowest white
cedar log loads increased significantly in stands older than
 years 

among snags the only significant relationships between
volumes and time since fire were for the total snag and bal 
sam fir snag volumes fig in both cases volumes in 
creased with time volumes of trembling aspen snags present
a u shaped pattern from to years and then disappear
after years some birch snags are present in young and
very old stands and show no particular trend white spruce
and white cedar did not have a sufficient number of stands
with snags 

effects of time since the last fire and stand composition
results for logs and snags tables and respectively 

show different behaviours of cwd in relation to time since
fire and canopy basal areas log loads of classes v and vi 
white spruce and white cedar are not reported in table as
they did not show significant linear relationships with time
or basal areas however basal areas and time since fire are
significant descriptors in four of the eight significant models
 table basal areas are the only significant descriptors in
three models whereas time since fire is the only significant
descriptor for the class i log load this implies that changes
in the log accumulation total and species log loads are in 
fluenced both by the effect of time since fire and by the
change in canopy species dominance reflecting successional
process moreover the species composition effect is as

important as time see table for outcome order entries
from the forward stepwise selection 

conversely time is always the first variable selected for
snags table with four cases where it is the only signifi 
cant variable even in models where basal areas are part of
significant descriptors only one species basal area is in 
cluded this implies that changes in snag components spe 
cies composition density basal area and volume are
almost only influenced by time since fire 

discussion

comparisons of cwd characteristics with other boreal
ecosystems

the presented snag components mean volume m ha 
mean density stems ha are at the upper limit of ranges
found to date in boreal forests lee et al linder et al 
 schimmel and granström sturtevant et al 
 if we only focus on snags larger than cm in dbh 

the mean snag volume per stand increases from to
 m ha corresponding with a slight decrease of mean
snag basal area from to m ha and a mean density
dropping from to snags ha these values fit better
to those of other studies moreover snag density and basal
area may reflect some processes such as self thinning and
natural disturbance effects indeed the maximum density of
 snags ha all diameters included was recorded in the
youngest aspen stands where trees are undergoing self 
thinning snag basal area is only m ha however only
one of these stands recorded a snag larger than cm in
dbh in mixed and conifer stands snag densities higher
than stems ha represent mostly balsam firs killed dur 
ing the last and most severe spruce budworm outbreak
 bergeron et al morin et al insects may have
also fed on sub dominant trees from to cm in dbh 
during the maximum defoliation period

showed hély differences with deciduous stands in
alberta – m ha lee et al and mixedwood
boreal stands in new brunswick – t ha freedman et al 
 it is likely that the drier climate in alberta creates a
less favourable environment for decomposer fungi this
would slow down bole decay rate and result in a greater log
accumulation conversely in new brunswick the moister
climate has inverse effects and it favours log decay more 
over freedman et al by sampling only logs greater
than cm in diameter have not taken into account small di 
ameter log loads that comprise up to of the total load in
our study area 

stand composition and time since the last fire as
descriptors of the change in the cwd accumulation

the analyses have shown that time since fire and stand
canopy composition are two significant descriptive factors in
cwd changes however while logs are influenced by both
factors snags are mainly influenced by time since fire 

the high correlation between species log loads and living

basal areas show that logs reflect the stand dynamics
through the successional process the dominant deciduous
species die and deciduous stands are replaced by mixed and
conifer stands in later successional stages bergeron and
dubuc other studies have recorded poor correlation
between the stand basal area and log composition muller
and liu sturtevant et al but species composi 
tion of cwd reflected the species composition of the stand 
ing forest muller and liu in our study log loads
respond almost immediately to the canopy species replace 
ment by a rapid change in their species composition this
rapid change can be explained by the rapid replacement of
the dominant canopy species that is also the largest log pro 
ducer at that time paré and bergeron have shown
that total aboveground biomass closely corresponds to the
trembling aspen biomass and when this species is replaced
by conifer species the total aboveground biomass decreases
in the same way moreover the involved species are known
to have rapid decay rates alban and pastor lambert

closely to the present load input and decay likely in equilib 
rium and also to the actual canopy composition it seems
that there is no long term accumulation process 

conversely the snags component changes are when they
exist mainly influenced by time since fire and to a lesser
extent by the canopy composition changes snags because
they are standing are drier and less exposed to decomposers 
would have a slower decay rate than logs thus snags can
then remain standing for a long time even though their spe 
cies no longer dominates the living stand canopy this ex 
plains why snag composition does not fit the actual living
tree canopy composition but that it is instead related to
stand age and to its history snags reflect the transition from
deciduous towards conifer dominance occurring during suc 
cession bergeron and dubuc the percentage of coni 
fer snags mainly represented by balsam fir increases with
time whereas trembling aspen which is the most prolific
deciduous snag producer has a snag density that varies with
time after fire shade intolerant species such as trembling
aspen dominate the stand canopy and the snag compartment
from self thinning from to years after fire snag vol 

ume is low but still dominated by deciduous species after
 years overmature aspen die and constitute high snag in 
puts conifer species mostly balsam fir finally replace de 
ciduous species in the canopy and produce at that time the
largest snag volumes particularly from outbreaks these in 
trinsic and extrinsic events created within a short time pe 
riod large amounts of snags standing for a long time after
the disturbance event moreover we also have to consider
the relationship between the timing of the sampling period
and spruce budworm outbreak events if cwd were sam 
pled – years ago the last spruce budworm outbreak
would not have occurred yet and the balsam fir cwd logs
and snags would have been less important additionally if
we were to sample cwd years from now with no spruce
budworm outbreaks ocurring the balsam fir snags would
have fallen and so would be less important

accumulation models agee and huff bormann and
likens harmon et al spies et al 
sturtevant et al as we have seen above the key fac 
tors explaining these differences for total or species loads 
are the species replacement occurring during succession
 bergeron and dubuc differences in species produc 
tivity paré and bergeron rapid decay rates lambert
et al harmon et al and disturbances such as
cyclic spruce budworm outbreaks killing mature balsam firs
and favouring white birch and or balsam fir regeneration
 kneeshaw and bergeron the cwd models in our
study do not show the high initial post fire cwd load re 
sulting from the fire event as in the traditional u shaped
model agee and huff bormann and likens 
spies et al sturtevant et al the initial load at
 years is composed of small diameter pieces that would
not have withstood the fire event and not from pre fire or

fire residual debris the absence of large pre fire cwd can
be explained by the faster decay rate of burned pieces a few
years after fire harmon et al and by the absence of
large diameter trees in pre fire stands indeed even in old
stands conifers that dominate stands are much smaller trees
and snag producers than deciduous species paré and
bergeron the log pattern of trembling aspen through
time found and discussed in our study shows the same trend
as the aboveground biomass found by paré and bergeron
 in the same study area and also as the trembling as 
pen snags in western canada found by lee et al 
this pattern is characterized by a first load increase until
stand maturity followed by a period of load decrease during
the late successional stages it resembles the aboveground
living biomass of forest stands presented by peet 
who assigned this accumulation pattern to boreal stands such
as feathermoss – black spruce stands with very thick organic

layer in our case the period of load decrease is not a de 
crease in the successive cohort productivity because of less
favorable abiotic conditions but to the species replacement
with a resulting decrease in the abundance of trembling as 
pen bergeron and dubuc paré and bergeron 
aspen and birch have no difference in decay rates but white
birch log accumulation is significantly higher than trembling
aspen same trend in fig moreover the birch trend
through time is more variable nonsignificant trend in fig 
than for aspen logs this variability difference may come
from the distinct life history patterns of these species white
birch is a long lived species with one postfire cohort that
can stand more than years frelich and lorimer 
dansereau and bergeron and create logs and snags
along the entire succession whereas the mean life span of
trembling aspen is years in eastern north america hosie
 aspen regenerates through successive cohorts over a
comparable period thus aspen produces high episodic
amounts of cwd fig for snags the birch pattern vari 
ability could also be explained by periodic openings of stand
canopy from balsam fir death during spruce budworm out 
breaks large gaps are favourable to white birch regenera 
tion kneeshaw and bergeron for white cedar this
study would have required a longer time window to record a
significant trend as this shade tolerant species only begins
to regenerate in the late stages bergeron and dubuc 
a recently discovered mesic forest dominated by white ce 
dar and regenerated at least years ago after a fire had a
total log load of t ha balsam fir white cedar and white
birch were responsible for and t ha respectively 
this suggests that mixed stands can be maintained for a long
time high variability of old stand composition also shown
by the cca and that high balsam fir log load was probably
created by the last spruce budworm outbreak however be 
cause of the longevity of white cedar it produces only small
log loads even in year old stands white spruce seems
the least active species in the successional replacement pro 
cess with a low abundance of living trees and few logs and
snags this could explain why there was no significant trend
over time for this species finally balsam fir accumulates
cwd during the entire succession the trend seems to be
dependent on both disturbance and decay rate because the
outbreak periods seem to be as long as the decay rate the
log pattern should stay stable over the long term until an 
other fire occurs
