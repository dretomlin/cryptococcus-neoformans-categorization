accurate climate projections require an understanding of 
the effects of warming on ecological communities and the 
underlying mechanisms that drive them – however little is 
known about the effects of climate warming on the succession 
of microbial communities here we examined the temporal 
succession of soil microbes in a long term climate change 
experiment at a tall grass prairie ecosystem experimental 
warming was found to significantly alter the community struc 
ture of bacteria and fungi by determining the time decay 
relationships and the paired differences of microbial commu 
nities under warming and ambient conditions experimental 
warming was shown to lead to increasingly divergent succes 
sion of the soil microbial communities with possibly higher 
impacts on fungi than bacteria variation partition and null 
model based analyses indicate that stochastic processes 
played larger roles than deterministic ones in explaining 
microbial community taxonomic and phylogenetic composi 
tions however in warmed soils the relative importance of 
stochastic processes decreased over time indicating a poten 
tial deterministic environmental filtering elicited by warming 
although successional trajectories of microbial communities 
are difficult to predict under future climate change scenarios 
their composition and structure are projected to be less vari 
able due to warming driven selection 

the acceleration of global climate warming a consequence of 
the build up of atmospheric co and other greenhouse gases due 
to fossil fuel combustion and land use change represents one of the 
greatest scientific and policy concerns in the twenty first century 
as climate especially temperature is a primary driver of biological 
processes climate warming has impacted terrestrial biodiversity at 
all system levels including shifting species’ geographical range 
phenology distribution and abundance all of which could poten 
tially increase the risk of extinction altering community structure 
and disrupting ecological interactions and ecosystem functioning 
consequently it is anticipated that climate warming will alter pat 
terns in spatial and temporal distributions of organisms however 
despite intensive studies examining the responses of ecological com 
munities to climate warming whether and how climate warming 

affects temporal succession of ecological communities particularly 
microbial communities remains elusive 

as knowledge of the temporal dynamics of ecological communi 
ties is critical for predicting the responses of biodiversity ecosystem 
functions and services to environmental change for example cli 
mate warming ecological succession has always been at the core 
of community ecology stages trajectories and mechanisms are 
central topics in successional studies the succession of ecological 
communities can be convergent divergent idiosyncratic or other 
complex forms in linear or nonlinear fashions previous stud 
ies showed that plant successions were divergent convergent – 
or showed no significant change and sometimes all patterns 
appeared within the same study moreover successional direction 
could be dependent on both spatial and temporal scales ecosys 
tem characteristics types of perturbation and functional traits 
used however only a few studies examined temporal succession 
in microbial communities and those showed convergent or diver 
gent behaviours 

in the last decades various manipulated multifactorial climate 
change field experiments have been established and offer 
unique opportunities for examining the temporal succession of ter 
restrial ecosystems in response to climate change across multiple 
environmental conditions therefore in this study we examined 
the temporal succession of soil microbial communities in response 
to experimental warming in a native tall grass prairie ecosystem of 
the us great plains in central oklahoma ° ʹ n ° ʹ w 
this long term multifactor climate change experiment was estab 
lished in and the warming treatment plots have been sub 
jected to continuous °c warming by infrared radiators in this 
report we primarily focus on the warming effects on microbial 
community succession by determining whether and how warming 
will alter temporal succession rates of the grassland soil microbial 
communities across different organismal groups for example bac 
teria and fungi whether warming will lead to divergent or con 
vergent succession of soil microbial communities and what the 
relative roles of deterministic and stochastic processes are in shap 
ing temporal succession of soil microbial communities in response 
to climate warming

over the last six years the average temperature in the surface 
soil was significantly p increased by °c and soil mois 
ture was decreased by in the warmed plots supplementary 
fig a b consistent with our previous study – some key ecosys 
tem processes including gross primary productivity gpp ecosys 
tem respiration er soil total respiration tr and heterotrophic 
respiration hr were significantly p altered by experimen 
tal warming supplementary fig c d the concentrations of soil 
nitrate significantly p increased but soil total nitrogen 
total organic carbon ammonia and soil ph remained unchanged 
under warming supplementary fig e f 

it is expected that the alterations in soil variables and plant pro 
ductivity in response to warming would lead to changes in micro 
bial communities over time to test this hypothesis a total of 
surface soil – cm samples taken annually from to 
from replicate plots under warming and control ambient con 
ditions were analysed using amplicon based sequencing of s 
ribosomal rna genes for bacteria and archaea and internal tran 
scribed spacers itss for fungi an average of ± and 
 ± sequence reads per sample were obtained for the 
 s rrna gene and its respectively the microbial community 
structures of bacteria and fungi were altered over time by warming 
as visualized by the non metric multidimensional scaling ordina 
tion based on the bray–curtis dissimilarity supplementary fig 
specifically the close clustering of warmed and control samples in 
 indicated similar soil microbial composition and structures 
of bacteria and fungi before warming treatment in the subsequent 
years the warmed samples were generally separated from the con 
trol samples on a yearly basis supplementary fig moreover 
three complementary non parametric multivariate statistical tests 
 adonis anosim and mrpp further revealed that the overall 
microbial community structures of bacteria and fungi across all 
years were significantly different p between the warmed 
and control plots table and supplementary table these results 
indicated that experimental warming significantly altered soil bac 
terial and fungal community composition and structure 

to understand the impacts of warming on the temporal turn 
overs of microbial community structure the time decay relation 
ships tdrs of soil bacteria and fungi were measured based on 
taxonomic diversity by a linear regression between log transformed 
community similarity and log transformed temporal distance 
since different facets of diversity could behave quite differently we 
also examined the tdrs based on phylogenetic diversity wherein 
the genetic relatedness of organisms in an environment is taken into 
account along with species richness and relative abundance the 
slopes of the linear regression tdr value v can reflect the tem 
poral turnover rates of soil microbes our results first revealed that 
under ambient temperature there were no significant tdrs based 
on either taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity for bacteria fig a c 

but there were significant tdrs with relatively small temporal turn 
over rates v – p for fungi fig b d in con 
trast both bacteria and fungi exhibited significant p tdrs 
under warming based on both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity 
 fig permutation tests indicated that the slopes of tdrs based 
on all diversity metrics were significantly steeper under warming 
than control for bacteria v – p and fungi 
 v – p fig considerably steeper slopes of 
tdrs under warming were observed for bacteria with abundance 
based metrics bray–curtis and or weighted unifrac and for fungi 
with bray–curtis supplementary fig a–c however such a trend 
was less obvious for fungi with weighted unifrac supplementary 
fig d second tdrs of different lineages of bacteria and fungi 
were also estimated at the phylum level based on taxonomic and 
phylogenetic diversity supplementary tables and different 
lineages in bacteria and fungi showed substantial variations of 
tdrs up to tenfold fig and supplementary fig particu 
larly in control plots which had fewer significant tdrs with 
relatively small or negative v for example chloroflexi in bacteria 
 fig and supplementary fig in contrast significant positive v 
was observed under warming for most of these phyla based on both 
taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity metrics for instance the 
phyla actinobacteria and proteobacteria in bacteria showed no sig 
nificant v under control conditions but significant v was observed 
in these phyla under warming supplementary tables and more 
importantly the rates of time decay of community structure for most 
of these phyla under warming were significantly p 
larger than those under control fig and supplementary fig 
third fungi exhibited a significantly p larger slope of tdrs 
 – times than bacteria and archaea under warming fig and 
supplementary fig suggesting that experimental warming may 
have differential effects on the temporal succession of bacteria and 
fungi in addition the temporal turnovers of microbial community 
composition and structure based on phylogenetic diversity metrics 
were significantly p lower than those based on taxonomic 
diversity metrics for most bacterial and fungal lineages figs 
and which could be because the experimental period six 
years was not sufficient to allow rapid phylogenetic divergences 
collectively all of these results indicated that six years of experimen 
tal warming significantly accelerated the temporal turnover rates of 
soil bacteria and fungi and these effects are also lineage dependent 

to further determine how warming affects the succession of 
bacterial and fungal communities over time differences of micro 
bial communities between paired warmed and control plots were 
determined on a yearly basis our results first showed that the 
differences of bacterial and fungal community structure between 
warming and control all increased linearly with time based on 
sorensen and unweighted unifrac for bacteria slope –
 p and fungi slope – p fig 
similarly the differences between warming and control based 
on bray–curtis and weighted unifrac also exhibited an increase 
with time for bacteria and fungi although the increases were not 
significant supplementary fig the paired differences of dif 
ferent lineages between warmed and control plots were also evalu 
ated supplementary tables and our results showed that over 
half of the bacterial and fungal phyla exhibited significantly or 
marginally significantly positive slopes of community difference 
between warming and control based on sorensen and unweighted 
unifrac dissimilarity metrics supplementary fig positive 
slopes of community difference between warming and control 
were observed in most of the lineages based on bray–curtis and 
weighted unifrac dissimilarity metrics supplementary fig in 
addition the paired differences of microbial communities between 
warmed and control plots were significantly p larger in 
fungi than bacteria based on various metrics fig suggesting 
that warming could have bigger impacts on the temporal turnovers

in fungi than bacteria significant correlations r – 
p of community difference were detected between bacte 
rial and fungal communities under warming and control based 
on various metrics except weighted unifrac supplementary 
fig together these results suggested that experimental warm 
ing significantly enhanced the divergent succession of soil bacte 
rial and fungal communities 

the altered microbial successional dynamics could be caused by 
a variety of environmental factors other than warming canonical 
correspondence analysis cca showed that composition and 
structure of bacteria and fungi were significantly f – 
p shaped by several common environmental variables 
including gpp er soil temperature nutrients moisture ph and 
time supplementary figs and the variation of bacterial 
community was explained more by soil temperature r 
p than moisture r p but soil moisture 
 r p explained higher variation of the fungal com 
munity than temperature r p supplementary 
figs and a partial mantel test also indicated that tempera 
ture was a more important factor for bacterial community and most 
bacterial lineages whereas soil moisture was more vital for fungal 
community and most fungal lineages supplementary table 
furthermore the cca and mantel test showed that the variations 
of microbial communities and their lineages significantly p 
correlated with gpp er tr and or hr suggesting that diver 
gent succession of microbial communities under warming could 
affect certain ecosystem functions supplementary tables and 
however a partial cca based variation partitioning analysis indi 
cated that relatively small portions – of the variations 

in bacterial and fungal community composition and structure were 
explained by the environmental variables examined supplementary 
figs and substantial portions of the community variations 
 – could not be explained by measured environmental 
variables suggesting that stochastic processes and or unmea 
sured environmental variables could play more important roles 
than deterministic processes in the assembly of the soil bacterial 
and fungal communities 

to further discern the importance of stochastic processes in 
shaping the soil community structure stochastic ratios were 
calculated on the basis of taxonomic and phylogenetic metrics 
after years of warming the stochastic processes contributed to 
considerable portions of the community variations under warm 
ing and control in taxonomic – and phylogenetic 
 – diversity fig these results suggested that sto 
chastic processes could play more important roles in shaping 
microbial community structure which is consistent with results 
from the variation partitioning analysis as described above 
interestingly warming significantly p decreased the rela 
tive importance of stochastic processes by – in shaping 
bacterial and fungal community structure fig furthermore 
the relative importance of stochastic processes in governing com 
munity structure decreased substantially over time under climate 
warming particularly for bacteria supplementary fig these 
results indicated that warming could act as a deterministic filter 
ing factor to impose significant selection on microorganisms for 
example selecting microorganisms processing carbon faster for 
their growth so that the overall community level stochasticity 
decreased over time

our study demonstrates that warming played an important role 
in accelerating temporal turnover rates of soil bacterial and fungal 
communities these results are consistent with a recent study show 
ing that temperature plays a primary role in shaping microbial 
community diversity our findings have important implications 
for predicting ecological consequences of climate warming on one 
hand since climate warming leads to microbial community diver 
gence microbial communities would be much more different from 
the contemporary community states under future climate change 
scenarios and there is a higher likelihood that microbial commu 
nities will diverge towards multiple alternative community states 
consequently the future successional trajectories in a warmed 
world will be less predictable based on the knowledge of contempo 
rary communities on the other hand since warming reduced sto 
chasticity over time the communities could converge more quickly 
to a community state with less stochasticity under warming thus 
if there is sufficient knowledge on the successional trajectories of 
the contemporary microbial communities the microbial commu 
nity composition and structure could be less variable under future 
climate warming however further research is needed to examine 
whether the warming induced divergent succession and declining 
importance of stochastic processes identified in this study are appli 
cable to other ecosystems

site description this study was conducted at the kessler atmospheric and 
ecological field station kaefs in the us great plains in mcclain county 
oklahoma ̊ ʹ n ̊ ʹ w kaefs is an old field tall grass prairie 
abandoned from field cropping years ago with light grazing until the 
grassland is dominated by c forbs ambrosia trifida solanum carolinense and 
euphorbia dentate and c grasses tridens flavus sporobolus compositus and 
sorghum halapense based on oklahoma climatological survey data from 
to the temperature ranges from °c in january to °c in july mean 
annual temperature °c and the precipitation ranges from mm in january 
and february to mm in may and june mean annual precipitation mm 
the soil type of this site is port–pulaski–keokuk complex which is a well drained 
soil that is formed in loamy sediment on flood plains the soil texture class is 
loam with of sand of silt and of clay the concentrations of soil 
organic matter and total nitrogen n are and respectively and the 
soil bulk density is g cm− the soil has a high available water holding capacity 
 neutral ph and a deep about cm moderately penetrable root zone 

the field site experiment was established in july of with a blocked split 
plot design in which warming is a primary factor two levels of warming ambient 
and °c were set for four pairs of m × m plots by utilizing a ‘real’ or 
‘dummy’ infrared radiator kalglo electronics in warmed plots a real infrared 
radiator was suspended m above the ground and the dummy infrared radiator 
was suspended to simulate a shading effect of the device in the control plots 

field measurements constantan copper thermocouples wired to a campbell 
scientific cr x data logger campbell scientific were used to measure and 
record soil temperature every min at and cm in the centre of each 
plot to represent the microclimate of the soil where the microbial communities 
were sampled the soil temperature data used in this study were the annual average 
values at cm depth across the whole year unfortunately probes and data lines 
for measuring soil water content were destroyed by rodents in the beginning of 
field experiment instead volumetric soil water content v from the soil surface 
to a cm depth was measured once or twice a month using a portable time 
domain reflectometer soil moisture equipment corp three measurements of 
soil moisture were performed in every plot and the average values were used in 
analyses the soil moisture data presented in this study were annually averaged 
across each year 

ecosystem carbon c fluxes were measured once or twice a month between 
 and local time as described previously net ecosystem exchange 
and er were measured using an li portable photosynthesis system li cor 
attached to a transparent chamber m × m × m which covered all of the 
vegetation within the aluminium frames gpp was estimated as the difference 
between net ecosystem exchange and er meanwhile soil tr and hr were 
measured using a li a soil flux system attached to a soil co flux chamber 
 li cor as described previously autotrophic respiration was estimated as the 
difference between tr and hr the annual average values of ecosystem c fluxes 
and respirations across each year were used to represent the responses of grassland 
ecosystem in this study 

above ground plant community investigations were annually conducted at 
peak biomass usually september as described previously above ground plant 
biomass separated into c and c species was indirectly estimated by a modified 
pin touch method a detailed description of biomass estimation is provided by 
sherry et al all of the species within each plot were identified to estimate species 
richness since there was no carryover of living biomass from previous years due 
to a distinct dormant season and negligible decomposition of biomass during the 
growing season in our ecosystem the estimated above ground plant biomass was 
considered to be above ground net primary production 

sampling and soil chemical measurements in this study surface – cm soil 
samples were collected annually in control and warmed plots at approximately 
the date of peak plant biomass september or october from to three 
soil cores cm diameter x cm deep were collected using a soil sampler tube 
and composited to have enough samples for soil chemistry microbiology and 
molecular biology analyses a total of soil samples were analysed in this study 

before microbial and chemical analyses visible roots cm and stones 
were removed from the soil by metal forceps all soil samples were analysed by 
the soil water and forage analytical laboratory at oklahoma state university 
 stillwater ok usa the organic c and total n contents in soil were determined 
using a dry combustion c and n analyser leco soil nitrate no − and 
ammonia nh were analysed using a lachat flow injection analyser 
 lachat soil ph was measured at a water to soil mass ratio of using a ph 
meter with a calibrated combined glass electrode 

dna extraction soil dna was extracted from g soil by freeze grinding and 
sds based lysis as described previously and purified with a mobio powersoil 
dna isolation kit mobio laboratories according to the manufacturer’s protocol 
dna quality was assessed on the basis of nm and nm absorbance 
ratios using a nanodrop nd spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies 
the final dna concentrations were quantified by picogreen using a fluostar 

optima fluorescence plant reader bmg labtech dnas were stored at − °c 
until sequencing analysis 

amplicon sequencing library construction and sequencing were 
processed using methods similar to those described in previous reports 
universal primer sets f ʹ gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa ʹ

rrna genes were used in this study library preparation was performed 
using a two step pcr to avoid extra pcr bias as previously documented 
phasing primers which contained different length spacers – bases between 
the sequencing primer and the target gene to randomize base position during 
sequencing were designed and used in the second step of the two step pcr the 
forward and reverse primers were used in a complementary manner to ensure 
that the total length of the amplified sequences remained constant both forward 
and reverse phasing primers have the illumina adaptor the illumina sequencing 
primer a spacer and the target gene primer and a barcode of bases in the 
reverse primer between the sequencing primer and the adaptor in the two step 
pcr soil dna was first diluted to ng μ l− with water to be used as a template 
in the pcr reaction the μ l pcr reaction system and conditions were described 
previously reactions of s rrna gene and its amplification were performed 
in triplicates after amplification the triplicate products were combined together 
visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by picogreen using a 
fluostar optima fluorescence plant reader bmg labtech 

pcr products from different samples were pooled at equal molality generally 
 samples to be sequenced in the same miseq run the pooled mixture was 
purified with a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen sciences and re quantified 
with picogreen sample libraries for sequencing were prepared according to the 
miseq reagent kit preparation guide illumina as described previously the 
pooled sample library was diluted to nm μ l of n fresh naoh was then 
added into μ l of sample dna for denaturation the denatured dna was diluted 
to pm and mixed with an equal volume of pm phi x library finally the mixture 
 μ l was loaded into a reagent cartridge and sequenced on a miseq illumina 
using × pair end sequencing kit by following manufacturer’s instructions 

sequence preprocessing the raw reads of the s rrna gene and its were 
collected by the miseq in fastq format and then submitted to our data analysis 
website http zhoulab rccc ou edu to be further analysed using a sequence 
analysis pipeline built on the galaxy platform after removing spiked phix reads 
the reads were assigned into different sample libraries based on the barcodes 
primer sequences at the end of each read were trimmed and the btrim program 
with a threshold of qc over a bp window size was used to filter the reads 
for s and its forward and reverse reads of the same sequence with at least 
 bp overlap and mismatches were combined using flash any joined 
sequences with an ambiguous base or a length of bp for the s rrna 
gene or bp for the its were discarded thereafter operational taxonomic 
units otus were clustered by uparse at identity and singletons were 
removed from the remaining sequences for both the s rrna gene and the its 
in uparse the green reference data set for s data and the unite qiime 
released its reference data set https unite ut ee repository php for its data 
were used as reference databases to remove chimaeras to normalize samples to the 
same total read abundance sequences for the s rrna gene and 
sequences for the its were randomly selected resampled for each sample otu 
taxonomic classification of the its and s rrna gene sequences was performed 
using representative sequences from each otu through the ribosomal database 
project classifier with confidence estimates 

sorensen and bray–curtis dissimilarity metrics were calculated to estimate 
taxonomic diversity based on the resampled otu tables in r using the vegan 
package weighted and unweighted unifrac distances were calculated to estimate 
phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities in r using the phyloseq package 
these taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity metrics were used to evaluate 
microbial tdr and succession rates in all subsequent analyses 

tdr and succession estimation similar to distance decay relationships the 
tdrs of microbial communities are usually evaluated using the similar linear 
regression between logarithmic β similarities and logarithmic temporal distance in 
the following form equation 

ε − s c v tln ln s

where ss is the pairwise similarity in community composition t is the time 
interval the slope v is the tdr value a measure of the temporal turnover rate of 
the community across time c is the intercept and ε is the residuals 

in this study we used the same moving window approach to assess time decay 
in microbial communities as previously described this approach involves 
partitioning a time series into different subset windows given the number of 
observations and fitting the tdr model in our annual survey data subset window

 included the pairwise similarity of samples that were one year apart subset 
window is the pairwise similarity of samples two years apart and so on in our 
six year record there are one year intervals two year intervals three year 
intervals down to five year interval for each plot this moving window approach 
is currently the dominant approach for tdrs – considering the repeated 
measures design tdr analysis counted only pairwise comparisons among time 
points within each plot that is pairwise comparisons for each plot and a total of 
 pairwise comparisons for each treatment 

in general the above tdr model is fitted as a linear model where the 
slope v and the intercept c are both constant across a data set however our 
experimental design has repeated measures at different time points in the same 
plot and different plots under the same treatment do not necessarily have the 
same slope and intercept thus we fitted the data for each treatment to the tdr 
model by an lmm rather than common linear model to make the slope v and 
intercept c variable at different plots each of them is divided into two parts 
 equations and one part λv and λc is constant and contributes to the 
‘fixed effect’ of the lmm equation which represents the average slope and 
intercept estimated across different plots the other part δv and δc can have 
different values in different plots with a mean expectation of zero contributing 
to the plot specific ‘random effect’ of the lmm equation the model was 
calculated using the function lmer in the r package lme with model setting as 
ln ss ln dt ln dt plot

fixed effect random effect

to evaluate how the data can be explained by the tdr model the coefficient 
of determination r was calculated for each lmm as described previously 
 named conditional r in nakagawa and schielzeth’s method the significance 
of each lmm was calculated by a permutation test rather than a parametric test 
considering the dependence among the pairwise comparisons the permutation 
test for the lmm randomized the time points years for times complete 
enumeration and the p value was calculated by comparing the akaike 
information criterion of the observed lmm with the permuted ones we also 
performed a permutation test to calculate the significance of the tdr value 
difference between warming and control the observed tdr value difference 
between warming and control was compared with the tdr value difference in 
permuted data sets to obtain the p value for tdr analysis in each phylum the 
relative abundance in each phylum was recalculated to reduce the dependence 
between phyla then tdr values v and significance for each phylum were 
calculated as described above to control the false discovery rate in multiple 
testing the p values of different phyla were corrected by the method ‘fdr’ using the 
function ‘p adjust’ in the r package ‘stats’ 

we evaluated the impacts of warming on the succession of soil bacterial 
and fungal communities using the distances of microbial communities between 
warming and control at each block in each year such comparisons will 
potentially minimize if not eliminate the effects of experimental noise due to 
annual sampling time differences environmental fluctuations molecular marker 
resolution and or technical variation on community temporal turnovers at each 
time point microbial communities in each warming plot were compared with the 
control plot in the same block generating a total of four pairwise comparisons in 
each year the difference between each pair of plots d was measured each year 
and the intercepts and slopes of temporal change between different pairs of plots 
are not necessarily the same therefore we fitted the temporal change to lmm with 
a random intercept and slope effect among different pairs of plots blocks

the model was set as d t t block where d represents dissimilarity 
and t represents year lmm r m r c and significance were calculated as described 
above for succession analysis in each phylum the relative abundance in each 
phylum was recalculated to reduce the dependence between phyla then the slope 
of community difference and the significance for each phylum were obtained as 
described above the p values of different phyla were corrected as described above 

stochastic community assembly beta diversity indices can provide insights into 
community assembly mechanisms to disentangle the importance of deterministic 

mechanisms from stochastic mechanisms underlying community assembly a 
null model analysis reported by chase et al was used based on both taxonomic 
 sorensen and phylogenetic beta mean nearest taxon distance metrics to 
evaluate the relative importance of stochastic processes in shaping community 
structure the stochastic ratio was calculated using the modified method as 
previously described since the taxonomic and phylogenetic metrics were 
originally derived from every pairwise comparison they may not be independent 
therefore we performed permutational multivariate analysis of variance with 
some modification considering our hypothesis and the repeated measures design 
we hypothesized that the stochasticity in community turnover among warming 
plots could be significantly different from that among control plots thus the 
treatment warming versus control was permuted within each block in each 
year rather than freely randomized across years in all randomized and observed 
data sets we counted the pairwise stochasticity values within each treatment in 
each year and compared the within warming stochasticity to the within control 
stochasticity the f value was calculated with ‘block’ and ‘year’ as constraints that 
is stochasticity warming error block × year the p value was calculated by 
comparing the observed f value with those from randomized data sets 

statistical analysis various statistical analyses were carried out using r software 
 with the package vegan v unless otherwise indicated difference of 
soil variables plant characteristics and ecosystem functions between warming and 
control was compared by repeated measures analysis of variance anova the 
microbial temporal patterns under warmed and control plots were determined 
by non metric multidimensional scaling ordination based on the bray–curtis 
dissimilarity three different non parametric multivariate statistical tests non 
parametric multivariate analysis of variance adonis analysis of similarity 
 anosim and multi response permutation procedure mrpp were used to 
test the differences in soil microbial communities under warming and control 
treatments for adonis the one way repeated measures anova model was set 
as ‘dissimilarity warming block × year’ when using the function adonis in the r 
package vegan for anosim and mrpp the permutation was constrained within 
each block in each year by setting ‘strata’ in the functions anosim and mrpp in the 
r package vegan cca was performed to determine the linkage between ecosystem 
functional parameters and microbial community structures the function envfit in 
the r package vegan was used to evaluate the association of microbial community 
variation and each environmental variable in cca the significance of the cca 
model was tested using anova based on cca results variation partitioning 
analysis was performed to determine the contributions of each individual variable or 
groups of variables to total variations in the soil microbial community composition 
mantel and partial mantel tests were also performed to calculate the correlations 
between environmental factors and soil microbial communities
