abstract

the biological carbon pump is the process by which co is transformed to organic carbon via 
photosynthesis exported through sinking particles and finally sequestered in the deep ocean 

while the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition the underlying 

ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterised here we use 

environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the tara oceans expedition to improve our 
understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean we show that specific plankton 

communities from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum correlate with carbon export at 

 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as radiolaria alveolate parasites as well as 

synechococcus and their phages as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the 
subtropical nutrient depleted oligotrophic ocean additionally we show that the relative 

abundance of just a few bacterial and viral genes can predict most of the variability in carbon 

export in these regions

marine planktonic photosynthetic organisms are responsible for approximately fifty percent 

of earth’s primary production and fuel the global ocean biological carbon pump the 

intensity of the pump is correlated to plankton community composition and controlled by 

the relative rates of primary production and carbon remineralisation about of this 

newly produced organic carbon in the surface ocean is exported through gravitational 

sinking of particles finally after multiple transformations a fraction of the exported 

material reaches the deep ocean where it is sequestered over thousand year timescales 

like most biological systems marine ecosystems in the sunlit upper layer of the ocean 

 denoted the euphotic zone are complex characterised by a wide range of biotic and 

abiotic interactions and in constant balance between carbon production transfer to 

higher trophic levels remineralisation and export to the deep layers the marine 

ecosystem structure and its taxonomic and functional composition likely evolved to comply 

with this loss of energy by modifying organism turnover times and by the establishment of 

complex feedbacks between them and the substrates they can exploit for metabolism 

decades of groundbreaking research have focused on identifying independently the key 

players involved in the biological carbon pump among autotrophs diatoms are commonly 

attributed to being important in carbon flux because of their large size and fast sinking 

rates while small autotrophic picoplankton may contribute directly through subduction 

of surface water or indirectly by aggregating with larger settling particles or consumption 

by organisms at higher trophic levels among heterotrophs zooplankton such as 

crustaceans impact carbon flux via production of fast sinking fecal pellets while migrating 
hundreds of meters in the water column these observations focusing on just a few 

components of the marine ecosystem highlight that carbon export results from multiple 

biotic interactions and that a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in its 

regulation will require an analysis of the entire planktonic ecosystem 

advanced sequencing technologies offer the opportunity to simultaneously survey whole 

planktonic communities and associated molecular functions in unprecedented detail such a 

holistic approach may allow the identification of community or gene based biomarkers that 

could be used to monitor and predict ecosystem functions e g related to the 
biogeochemistry of the ocean here we leverage global scale ocean genomics datasets 

from the euphotic zone and associated environmental data to assess the coupling 

between ecosystem structure functional repertoire and carbon export at m 

carbon export and plankton community composition

the tara oceans global circumnavigation crossed diverse ocean ecosystems and sampled 
plankton at an unprecedented scale see methods hydrographic data were measured in 
situ or in seawater samples at all stations as well as nutrients oxygen and photosynthetic 
pigments see methods net primary production npp was derived from satellite 

measurements see methods in addition particle size distributions μm to a few mm 
and concentrations were measured using an underwater vision profiler uvp from which 

carbon export corresponding to the carbon flux fig a at m was calculated to range 

from to mg m− d− using methods previously described see methods one

should keep in mind that fluxes are calculated from images of particles these estimates are 

derived from an approximation of stokes’ law relating the equivalent spherical diameter of 

particles to carbon flux see methods this exponential approximation is reasonable 

assuming similar particle composition across all sizes as highlighted by the standard 

deviations of parameters in eq see methods furthermore because of instrument and 

method limitations particles μm were not used which may underestimate total carbon 
fluxes finally these fluxes are instantaneous because they do not integrate space and time 

as sediment traps would however the approach allowed us to assemble the largest 

homogeneous carbon export dataset during a single expedition corresponding to more than 

 profiles over stations this dataset is of similar magnitude to the body of historical 

data available in the literature that includes the deep sediment trap based carbon flux 

time series from the jgofs program and the thorium derived particulate organic 

carbon poc export measurements 

from globally distributed sites a total of tb of metagenomics data representing 

million non redundant genes around operational taxonomic units otus of 

prokaryotes bacteria and archaea and numerous mainly uncharacterized viruses and 

picoeukaryotes have been described recently in addition a set of million 

eukaryotic s rdna ribotypes was generated from a subset of sampling sites 

corresponding to approximately otus fig a finally viral 

“populations” were identified at sites from viral metagenomic contigs only 

of which had been previously observed see methods these genomics data combined 

across all domains of life and viruses together with carbon export estimates and other 

environmental parameters were used to explore the relationships between marine 

biogeochemistry and euphotic plankton communities see methods in the top m of the 

oligotrophic open ocean our study did not include high latitude areas due to the current lack 

of available molecular data and results should not be extrapolated to deeper depths 

using a method for regression based modeling of high multidimensional data in biology 

 specifically a sparse partial least square analysis spls extended data fig we 

detected several plankton lineages for which relative sequence abundance correlated with 

carbon export and other environmental parameters most notably with npp as expected fig 

 b and see supplementary table these included diatoms dinoflagellates and metazoa 

 zooplankton lineages classically identified as key contributors to carbon export 

plankton community networks associated with carbon export

while the analysis presented in fig b supports previous findings about key organisms 

involved in carbon export from the euphotic zone it is not able to capture how the 

intrinsic structure of the planktonic community relates to this biogeochemical process 

conversely although other recent holistic approaches used species co occurrence 

networks to reveal potential biotic interactions they do not provide a robust description of 

sub communities driven by abiotic interactions to overcome these issues we applied a 

systems biology approach known as weighted gene correlation network analysis 

 wgcna to detect significant associations between the tara oceans genomics data 
and carbon export this method delineates communities in the euphotic zone that are the

most associated with carbon export rather than predicting organisms associated with sinking 

particles 

in brief the wgcna approach builds a network in which nodes are features in this case 

plankton lineages or gene functions and links are evaluated by the robustness of co 

occurrence scores wgcna then clusters the network into modules hereafter denoted 

subnetworks that can be examined to find significant subnetwork trait relationships we 

then filtered each subnetwork using a partial least square pls analysis that emphasizes 

key nodes based on the variable importance in projection vip scores see methods and 

extended data fig these particular nodes are mandatory to summarize a subnetwork or 

community related to carbon export in particular they are of interest for evaluating i 

subnetwork robustness and ii predictive power for a given trait see methods and extended 

data fig 

we applied wgcna to the relative abundance tables of eukaryotic prokaryotic and viral 

lineages and identified unique subnetworks significantly associated with carbon export 

within each dataset see methods and supplementary tables the eukaryotic 

subnetwork subnetwork trait relationship to carbon export pearson cor p e− 
contained lineages extended data fig a and supplementary table among which 

 represented photosynthetic organisms fig a and supplementary table 

surprisingly this small subnetwork’s structure correlates very strongly to carbon export 

 pearson cor p e− extended data fig d and it predicts as much as 
 leave one out cross validated loocv r of the variability in carbon export 

 extended data fig g only of the subnetwork nodes correspond to diatoms and they 

show lower vip scores than dinoflagellates supplementary table this is likely because 

our samples are not from silicate replete conditions where diatoms were blooming 

furthermore our analysis did not incorporate data from high latitudes where diatoms are 

known to be particularly important for carbon export so this result suggests that 

dinoflagellates have a heretofore unrecognized role in carbon export processes in subtropical 

oligotrophic ‘type’ ecosystems more precisely four of the five highest vip scoring 

eukaryotic lineages that correlated with carbon export at m were heterotrophs such as 

metazoa copepods non photosynthetic dinophyceae and rhizaria fig a and 
supplementary table these results corroborate recent metagenomics analysis of 

microbial communities from sediment traps in the oligotrophic north pacific subtropical 

gyre consistently in situ imaging surveys have revealed rhizarian lineages made up of 
large fragile organisms such as the collodaria to represent an until now under appreciated 

component of global plankton biomass which here also appear to be of relevance for 

carbon export another of lineages from the subnetwork correspond to parasitic 

organisms a largely under explored component of planktonic ecosystems when studying 

carbon export

the highest vip score within this community was assigned to synechococcus followed by 
cobetia pseudoalteromonas and idiomarina as well as vibrio and arcobacter fig b and 
supplementary table noteworthy prochlorococcus genera and sar clade fall out of 
this community while the significance of synechococcus for carbon export could be 
validated using absolute cell counts estimated by flow cytometry pearson cor p 
 e− extended data fig k moreover prochlorococcus cell counts did not correlate with 
carbon export pearson cor − p extended data fig j whereas the 
synechococcus to prochlorococcus cell count ratio correlated positively and significantly 
 pearson cor p e− extended data fig l suggesting the relevance of 
synechococcus rather than prochlorococcus to carbon export interestingly 
pseudoalteromonas idiomarina vibrio and arcobacter of which several species are known 
to be associated with eukaryotes have also been observed in live and poisoned sediment 

traps and display very high vip scores in the subnetwork associated with carbon export 

additional genera reported as being enriched in poisoned traps also known as being 

associated with eukaryotes include enterovibrio and campylobacter and are present as well 
in the carbon export associated subnetwork 

interestingly the viral subnetwork involving populations most related to carbon export 

at m pearson cor p e− extended data fig c contained particularly high 
vip scores for two synechococcus phages fig c and supplementary table which 
represented a fold enrichment fisher’s exact test p e− its structure also 
correlated with carbon export pearson cor p e− extended data fig f and 
could predict up to of the variability of carbon export loocv r extended 

data fig i the significance of these convergent results is reinforced by the fact that 

sequences from these datasets are derived from organisms collected on independent size 

filters see methods and further implicates the importance of top down processes in carbon 

export 

with the aim of integrating eukaryotic prokaryotic and viral communities in the euphotic 

zone with carbon export at m we synthesized their respective subnetworks using a 

single global co occurrence network established previously the resulting network focused 

on key lineages and their predicted co occurrences fig lineages with high vip values 

 such as synechococcus are revealed as hubs of the co occurrence network illustrating 
the potentially strategic key roles within the integrated network of lineages under 

appreciated by conventional methods to study carbon export associations between the hub 

lineages are mostly mutually exclusive which may explain the relatively weak correlation of 

some of these lineages with carbon export when using standard correlation analyses as 

shown in fig b 

gene functions associated with carbon export

given the potential importance of prokaryotic processes influencing the biological carbon 

pump we used the same analytical approaches to examine the prokaryotic genomic 

functions associated with carbon export at m in the annotated ocean microbial 

reference gene catalogue from tara oceans we built a global co occurrence network for 
functions i e orthologous groups of genes or ogs from the euphotic zone and identified

the majority of functions in fnet and fnet correlate well with carbon export fnet

interestingly fnet functions n encode mostly core functions i e functions 
observed in all euphotic samples see methods while the majority of fnet functions 

 n are non core see supplementary tables highlighting both essential and 
adaptive ecological functions associated with carbon export top vip scoring functions in 

the fnet subnetwork are membrane proteins such as abc type sugar transporters 

 extended data fig c this subnetwork also contains many functions specific to the 

synechococcus accessory photosynthetic apparatus e g relating to phycobilisomes 
phycocyanin and phycoerythrin see supplementary table which is consistent with the 

major role of this genus for carbon export inferred from the prokaryotic subnetwork fig 

 b in addition functions related to carbohydrates inorganic ion transport and metabolism 

as well as transcription are also well represented fig suggesting overall a subnetwork 

of functions dedicated to photosynthesis and growth 

the fnet subnetwork contains several functions encoded by genes taxonomically 

assigned to candidatus pelagibacter and prochlorococcus known as occupying similar 
oceanic regions as synechococcus but overall most of its relative abundance is 
taxonomically unclassified extended data fig e top vip scoring functions in fnet are 

also membrane proteins and abc type sugar transporters as well as functions involved in 

carbohydrate breakdown such as a chitinase extended data fig c these features 

highlight the potential roles of bacteria in the formation and degradation of marine 

aggregates strikingly and of ogs with a vip score in fnet and fnet

estimated from particle size distribution in a global dataset but should be taken with caution 

as the estimates do not account for particle composition in addition these export estimates 

evaluate how much carbon leaves the euphotic zone but they are not related and should not 

be extrapolated to sequestration which occurs after remineralisation deeper in the water 

column and over longer timescales nonetheless the use of the uvp was the only realistic 

method to evaluate carbon flux over the years expedition because deployment of sediment 

traps at all stations would have been impossible while our findings are consistent with the 

numerous previous studies that have highlighted the central role of copepods and diatoms in 

carbon export they place them in an ecosystem context and reveal hypothetical 

processes correlating with the intensity of export such as parasitism and predation for 

example while viruses are commonly assumed to lyse cells and maintain fixed organic 

carbon in surface waters thereby reducing the intensity of the biological carbon pump 

there are hints that viral lysis may increase carbon export through the production of colloidal 

particles and aggregate formation our current study suggests that these latter roles may be 

more ubiquitous than currently appreciated the importance of aggregation and cell 

stickiness as inferred from gene network analysis should be further explored mechanistically 

to investigate the biological significance of these findings 

the future evolution of the oceanic carbon sink remains uncertain because of poorly 

constrained processes particularly those associated with the biological pump with current 

trends in climate change the size and biodiversity of phytoplankton are predicted to 

decrease globally furthermore in spite of the potential importance of viruses revealed 

in this study they have largely been ignored because of limitations in sampling technologies 

consequently as oligotrophic gyres expand and global mean npp decreases the field is 

currently unable to predict the consequences for carbon export from the ocean’s euphotic 

zone by pinpointing key lineages and key microbial functions that correlate with carbon 

export at m in these areas this study provides a framework to address this critical 

bottleneck however the associations presented do not necessarily suggest a causal effect on 

carbon export which will require further investigation 

one of the grand challenges in the life sciences is to link genes to ecosystems based on 

the posit that genes can have predictable ecological footprints at community and ecosystem 

levels the tara oceans data sets have allowed us to predict as much as of the 
variability in carbon export from the oligotrophic surface ocean with just a small number of 

genes largely with unknown functions encoded by prokaryotes and viruses these findings 

can be used as a basis to include biological complexity and guide experimental work 

designed to inform climate modeling of the global carbon cycle such statistical analyses 

scaling from gene to ecosystems may open the way to the development of a new conceptual 

and methodological framework to better understand the mechanisms underpinning key 

ecological processes

were selected to represent distinct marine ecosystems at a global scale note that southern 

ocean stations were not examined herein because they were ranked as outliers due to their 

exceptional environmental characteristics and biota environmental data were obtained 

from vertical profiles of a sampling package it consisted of conductivity and 

temperature sensors chlorophyll and cdom fluorometers light transmissometer wetlabs 

c star cm a backscatter sensor wetlabs eco bb a nitrate sensor satlantic 

isus and a hydroptic underwater vision profiler uvp hydroptics nitrate and 

fluorescence to chlorophyll concentrations as well as salinity were calibrated from water 

samples collected with niskin bottle net primary production npp data were extracted 

from day composites of the vertically generalized production model vgpm at the 

week of sampling carbon fluxes and carbon export corresponding to the carbon flux at 

 m were estimated based on particle concentration and size distributions obtained from 

the uvp and details are presented below 

from particle size distribution to carbon export estimation

previous research has shown that the distribution of particle size follows a power law over 

the μm to the mm size range this junge type distribution translates into the following 
mathematical equation whose parameters can be retrieved from uvp images 

 eq 

where d is the particle diameter and exponent k is defined as the slope of the number 
spectrum when equation is log transformed this slope is commonly used as a descriptor 

of the shape of the aggregate size distribution 

the carbon based particle size approach relies on the assumption that the total carbon flux 

of particles f corresponds to the flux spectrum integrated over all particle sizes 

 eq 

where n d is the particle size spectrum i e equation and m d is the mass here carbon 
content of a spherical particle described as 

 eq 

where α πρ ρ is the average density of the particle and w d is the settling rate 
calculated using stokes law 

 eq 

where β g ρ – ρ νρ − g is the gravitational acceleration ρ the fluid density and ν 
the kinematic viscosity

in addition mass and settling rates of particles m d and w d respectively are often 
described as power law functions of their diameter obtained by fitting observed data m d 
w d adb the particles carbon flux can then be estimated using an approximation of eq 
 over a finite number x of small logarithmic intervals for diameter d spanning from 
μm to mm particles μm and mm are not considered consistent with the 
method presented by guidi et al such as

 eq 

where a ± and b ± have been estimated using a global dataset that 
compared particle fluxes in sediment traps and particle size distributions from the uvp 

images 

genomic data collection

for the sake of consistency between all available datasets from the tara oceans expeditions 
we considered subsets of the data recently published in science in brief one sample 

corresponds to data collected at one depth surface srf or deep cholorophyll maximum 

 dcm determined from the profile of chlorophyll fluorometer and at one station to study 

the eukaryotic community in our current manuscript we selected stations at which we had 

environmental data and carbon export estimated at m with the uvp and all size 

fractions consequently a subset of stations corresponding to samples has been 

created compared to the stations analyzed in de vargas et al a similar procedure 
has been applied to the prokaryotic and viral datasets reducing the sunagawa et al 
prokaryotic dataset to a subset of samples from stations and the brum et al 
viral dataset into a subset of samples from stations see supplementary table in 

addition a detailed table is provided summarizing which samples depth and station are 

available for each domain supplementary table 

eukaryotic taxa profiling

photic zone eukaryotic plankton diversity has been investigated through millions of 

environmental illumina reads sequences of the s ribosomal rna gene v region were 

obtained by pcr amplification and a stringent quality check pipeline has been applied to 

remove potential chimera or rare sequences details on data cleaning in de vargas et al 
 for stations and if possible at two depths srf and dcm eukaryotic 

communities were sampled in the piconano μm micro μm and meso 
plankton μm fractions a detailed list of these samples is given in supplementary 

table in the framework of the carbon export study sequences from all size fractions 

were pooled in order to get the most accurate and statistically reliable dataset of the 

eukaryotic community the million eukaryotic ribotypes were assigned to known 

eukaryotic taxonomic entities by global alignment to a curated database to get the most 

accurate vision of the eukaryotic community sequences showing less than identity with 

reference sequences were excluded the final eukaryotic relative abundance matrix used in 

our analyses included lineages taxonomic assignation has been performed using a last

common ancestor methodology and had thus been performed down to species level when 

possible in samples from stations pooled abundance number of v sequences of 

each lineage has been normalized by the total sum of sequences in each sample 

prokaryotic taxa profiling

to investigate the prokaryotic lineages communities were sampled in the pico plankton 

both filter sizes have been used along the tara oceans transect up to station 
prokaryotic fractions correspond to a μm size fraction and from station 
prokaryotic fractions correspond to a μm size fraction prokaryotic taxonomic 
profiling was performed using s rrna gene tags directly identified in illumina sequenced 

metagenomes mitags as described in logares et al s mitags were mapped to 
cluster centroids of taxonomically annotated s reference sequences from the silva 

database release ssu ref nr that had been clustered at sequence identity 

using usearch v s mitag counts were normalized by the total reads count in 

each sample further details in sunagawa et al the photic zone prokaryotic 
relative abundance matrix used in our analyses included mitags corresponding to 

 genera in samples from stations 

prokaryotic functional profiling

for each prokaryotic sample gene relative abundance profiles were generated by mapping 

reads to the om rgc using the mocat pipeline the relative abundance of each 

reference gene was calculated as gene length normalized base counts and functional 

abundances were calculated as the sum of the relative abundances of these reference genes 

annotated to og functional groups in our analyses we used the subset of the om rgc that 

was annotated to bacteria or archaea m genes using a rarefied to m inserts 

gene count table an og was considered to be part of the ocean microbial core if at least one 

insert from each sample was mapped to a gene annotated to that og for further details on 

the prokaryotic profiling please refer to sunagawa et al the final prokaryotic 
functional relative abundance matrix used in our analyses included ogs or functions 

in samples from stations genes from functions of fnet and fnet subnetworks 

were taxonomically annotated using a modified dual blast based last common ancestor 

 blca approach we used rapsearch rather than blast to efficiently process the 

large data volume and a database of non redundant protein sequences from uniprot version 

uniref and eukaryotic transcriptome data not represented in uniref see 

supplementary table for full annotations 

enumeration of prokaryotes by flow cytometry

for prokaryote enumeration by flow cytometry three aliquots of ml of seawater pre 

filtered by μm mesh were collected from both srf and dcm the samples were fixed 

immediately using cold glutaraldehyde final concentration left in the dark for 

 min at room temperature flash frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen on board and then 

stored at − °c on land two subsamples were taken to separate counts of heterotrophic 

prokaryotes not shown herein and phototrophic picoplankton for heterotrophic prokaryote

the dark to complete the staining and run in the flow cytometer we used a facscalibur 

 becton dickinson flow cytometer equipped with a mw argon ion laser nm 

emission at least events were acquired for each subsample usually 

events fluorescent beads μm fluoresbrite carboxylate microspheres polysciences inc 

warrington pa were added at a known density as internal standards the bead standard 

concentration was determined by epifluorescence microscopy for phototrophic 

picoplankton we used the same procedure as for heterotrophic prokaryote but without 

addition of syto data analysis was performed with flowjo software tree star inc 

profiling of viral populations

in order to associate viruses to carbon export we used viral populations as defined in brum 
et al using a set of tara oceans viromes briefly viral populations were defined 
as large contigs predicted genes and kb identified as most likely originating from 

bacterial or archaeal viruses these contigs remained and were then clustered into 

populations if they shared more than of their genes at nucleotide identity this 

resulted in ‘populations’ from the contigs where as many as contigs were 

included per population for each population the longest contig was chosen as the ‘seed’ 

representative sequence the relative abundance of each population was computed by 

mapping all quality controlled reads to the set of non redundant populations 

 considering only mapping quality scores greater than with bowtie and if more than 

 of the reference sequence was covered by virome reads the relative abundance of a 

population in a sample was computed as the number of base pairs recruited to the contig 

normalized to the total number of base pairs available in the virome and the contig length if 

more than of the reference sequence was covered by virome reads and set to 

otherwise see brum et al for further details the final viral population abundance 
matrix used in our analyses included viral population contigs in samples from 

stations 

viral host predictions

the longest contig in a population was defined as the seed sequence and considered the best 

estimate of that population’s origin these seed sequences were used to assess taxonomic 

affiliation of each viral population cases where of the genes were affiliated to a 

specific reference genome from refseq virus based on a blastp comparison with 

thresholds of for bit score and − for e value with an identity percentage of at least 

 at the protein sequence level were considered as confident affiliations to the 

corresponding reference virus the viral population host group was then estimated based on 

these confident affiliations see supplementary table for host affiliation of viral 

population contigs associated to carbon export 

viral protein clusters

viral protein clusters pcs correspond to orfs initially mapped to existing clusters pov 

gos and phage genomes the remaining unmapped orfs were self clustered using cd hit 

as described in brum et al only pcs with more than two orfs were considered 
bona fide and were used for subsequent analyses to compute pc relative abundance for 

statistical analyses reads were mapped back to predicted orfs in the contigs dataset using

mosaik as described in brum et al read counts to pcs were normalized by 
sequencing depth of each virome importantly we restricted our analyses to pcs 

associated to the viral population contigs significantly associated to carbon export in 

samples from stations 

sparse partial least squares analysis

in order to directly associate eukaryotic lineages to carbon export and other environmental 

traits fig b we used sparse partial least square spls as implemented in the r 

package mixomics we applied the spls in regression mode which will model a causal 
relationship between the lineages and the environmental traits i e pls will predict 
environmental traits e g carbon export from lineage abundances this approach enabled us 
to identify high correlations see supplementary table between certain lineages and 

carbon export but without taking into account the global structure of the planktonic 

community 

co occurrence network model analysis

weighted correlation network analysis wgcna was performed to delineate feature 

 lineages viral populations pcs or functions subnetworks based on their relative 

abundance a signed adjacency measure for each pair of features was calculated by 

raising the absolute value of their pearson correlation coefficient to the power of a parameter 

p the default value p was used for each global network except for the prokaryotic 

functional network where p had to be lowered to in order to optimize the scale free 

topology network fit indeed this power allows the weighted correlation network to show a 

scale free topology where key nodes are highly connected with others the obtained 

adjacency matrix was then used to calculate the topological overlap measure tom which 

for each pair of features taking into account their weighted pairwise correlation direct 

relationships and their weighted correlations with other features in the network indirect 

relationships for identifying subnetworks a hierarchical clustering was performed using a 

distance based on the tom measure this resulted in the definition of several subnetworks 

each represented by its first principal component 

these characteristic components play a key role in weighted correlation network analysis 

on the one hand the closeness of each feature to its cluster referred to as the subnetwork 

membership is measured by correlating its relative abundance with the first principal 

component of the subnetwork on the other hand association between the subnetworks and 

a given trait is measured by the pairwise pearson correlation coefficients between the 

considered environmental trait and their respective principal components a similar protocol 

has been performed on the eukaryotic relative abundance matrix the prokaryotic relative 

abundance matrix the prokaryotic functions relative abundance matrix and the viral 

population and pc relative abundance matrices all procedures were applied on hellinger 

transformed log scaled abundances noteworthy the protocol is not sensitive to copy 

number variation as observed across different eukaryotic species because the association 

between two species relies on a correlation score between relative abundance measurements 

computations were carried out using the r package wgcna

given the nature of the eukaryotic dataset three distinct size fractions the sampling 

process may lead to the loss of size fractions in particular samples 

 are eventually biases by such a loss supplementary table 

a complementary wgcna analysis was performed with addition of these samples to 

evaluate the robustness of our protocol to missing size fractions the composition of the 

eukaryotic subnetwork built with an extended dataset i e samples from stations for 
which size fractions were missing in samples was compared to the subnetwork as 

presented above i e samples from stations both subnetworks shown an overlap of 
 of lineage whereas four of the top five vip lineages with the extended dataset see 

extended data fig for details can be found in the top six vip lineages of the above 

subnetwork supplementary table emphasizing highly similar results and a small 

sensitivity to size fraction loss 

extraction of subnetworks related to carbon export

for each subnetwork called modules within wgcna extracted from each global network 

pairwise pearson correlation coefficients between the subnetwork principal components and 

the carbon export estimation was computed as well as corresponding p values corrected for 

multiple testing using the benjamini hochberg fdr procedure the subnetworks showing 

the highest correlation scores are of interest and were investigated one subnetwork 

nodes was significant within the eukaryotic network one subnetwork nodes was 

significant for the prokaryotic network one subnetwork nodes was significant within 

the virus network two subnetworks and nodes were significant within the 

prokaryotic functional network and two subnetworks and nodes were 

significant within the viral pcs network 

partial least squares regression

in addition to the network analyses we asked whether the identified subnetworks can be 

used as predictors for the carbon export estimations to answer this question we used partial 

least squares pls regression which is a dimensionality reduction method that aims at 

determining predictor combinations with maximum covariance with the response variable 

the identified combinations called latent variables are used to predict the response 

variable the predictive power of the model is assessed by correlating the predicted vector 

with the measured values the significance of the prediction power was evaluated by 

permuting the data times for each permutation a pls model was built to predict the 

randomized response variable and a pearson correlation was calculated between the 

permuted response variable and in leave one out cross validation loocv predicted 

values the random correlations are compared to the performance of the pls model 

that were used to predict the true response variable in addition the predictors were ranked 

according to their value importance in projection vip the vip measure of a predictor 

estimates its contribution in the pls regression the predictors having high vip values are 

assumed important for the pls prediction of the response variable the vip values of the 

prokaryotic functional subnetworks are provided in supplementary tables for the sake 

of illustration only lineages or functions with vip are discussed and pictured in figure 

 and our computations were carried out using the r package pls all programs are 

available under gpl licence

subnetwork representations

nodes of the subnetworks represent either lineages eukaryotic prokaryotic or viral or 

functions prokaryotic or viral subnetworks related to the carbon export have been 

represented in two distinct formats scatter plots represent each nodes based on their 

pearson correlation to the carbon export and their respective node centrality within the 

subnetwork the latter has been recomputed using significant spearman correlations above 

 for viral pcs as edges this is done for visualization purposes since wgcna 

subnetworks based on the topology overlap measure tom between nodes are hyper 

connected size representation of nodes are proportional to the vip score after pls the 

hiveplots depict the same subnetworks by focusing on two main features x axis and y axis 

depict nodes of subnetworks ranked by their vip scores and pearson correlation to the 

carbon export respectively

co occurrence co occurrence scores between nodes are weights allocated to corresponding 

edges these weights are magnified by a power law function until the graph becomes scale 

free the graph is then decomposed within subnetworks groups of otus that are analyzed 

separately one subnetwork group of otus is considered of interest when its topology is 

related to the trait of interest in the current case carbon export for each subnetwork for 

instance the subnetwork related to carbon export each otu is spread within a feature space 

that plots each otu based on its membership to the subnetwork x axis and its correlation 

to the environmental trait of interest i e carbon export a good regression of all otus 

emphasizes the putative relation of the subnetwork topology and the carbon export trait i e 
the more a given otu defines the subnetwork topology the more it is correlated to carbon 

export c depiction of the machine learning pls approach that was applied following

subnetworks related to carbon export at m
major lineages were selected within the three subnetworks vip supplementary tables 

 and co occurrences between all lineages of interest were extracted if present from a 

previously established global co occurrence network see methods only lineages discussed 

within the study are pinpointed the resulting graph is composed of nodes edges 

with a diameter of and average weighted degree of
