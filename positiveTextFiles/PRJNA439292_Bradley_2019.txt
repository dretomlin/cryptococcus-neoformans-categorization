suspended growth mixed community phototrophic wastewater treatment systems including high rate
algal ponds and photobioreactors have the potential to achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus
recovery with effluent nutrient concentrations below the current limit of technology in order to achieve
reliable and predictive performance it is necessary to establish a thorough understanding of how design
and operational decisions influence the complex community structure governing nutrient recovery in
these systems solids residence time srt a critical operational parameter governing growth rate was
leveraged as a selective pressure to shape microbial community structure in laboratory scale photo 
bioreactors fed secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment plant in order to decouple the
effects of srt and hydraulic retention time hrt nutrient loading was fixed across all experimental
conditions and the effect of changing srt on microbial community structure diversity and stability as
well as its impact on nutrient recovery was characterized reactors were operated at distinct srts 
and days with diurnal lighting over long term operation srts and in depth examination of the
eukaryotic and bacterial community structure was performed using amplicon based sequencing of the
 s and s rrna genes respectively in order to better represent the microalgal community structure 
this study leveraged improved s rrna gene primers that have been shown to provide a more accurate
representation of the wastewater process relevant algal community members long term operation
resulted in distinct eukaryotic communities across srts independent of the relative abundance of
operational taxonomic units otus in the inoculum the longest srt days srt resulted in a
more stable algal community along with stable bacterial nitrification while the shortest srt days srt
 resulted in a less stable more dynamic community although srt was not strongly associated with
overall bacterial diversity the eukaryotic community of srt was significantly less diverse and less
even than srt with a few dominant otus making up a majority of the eukaryotic community structure
in the former overall although longer srts promote stable bacterial nitrification short srts promote
higher eukaryotic diversity increased functional stability and better total n removal via biomass
assimilation these results indicate that srt may be a key factor in not only controlling microalgal
community membership but community diversity and functional stability as well ultimately the effi 
cacy and reliability of nh þ removal may be in tension with tn removal in mixed phototrophic systems
given that lower srts may achieve better total n removal via biomass assimilation through increased
eukaryotic diversity biomass productivity and functional stability

infrastructure and financial pressures to maintain and improve
existing services asce in response to these challenges 
there is unprecedented interest in transforming traditional waste 
water treatment plants into integrated resource recovery facilities
that recover nutrients and energy rather than consuming them
 guest et al mihelcic et al sturm verstraete
et al to this end microalgal systems are being pursued as
a promising technology that may enable simultaneous wastewater
treatment and feedstock production by assimilating nutrients

microalgae to manage organic n and p a capability that often
evades conventional biological nutrient removal systems may help

traditionally the widespread use of microalgae in municipal
wastewater treatment has been limited to the treatment of raw
sewage primary effluent or secondary effluent in lagoons where
they provide oxygen for aerobic heterotrophic bacteria for

tional parameters such as co sutherland et al mixing

removal in particular one of the most commonly studied opera 
tional parameters has been hydraulic retention time hrt 
 anbalagan et al takabe et al suspended systems
such as hraps most often operate with no separation between hrt

productivity and biochemical composition among other charac 
teristics studies have examined the effect of hrt on nutrient
removal anbalagan et al cromar and fallowfield 
biochemical composition e g lipid content woertz et al 
and algal community ecology yang et al but it can be
difficult to discern causal effects or to examine underlying trends in
these systems because nutrient loading and growth rate are
changed simultaneously a few studies have examined the effect of
srt on nutrient removal and community ecology in suspended
systems but these have been limited to experiments dominated by
seed pure cultures xu et al or run using synthetic
wastewater xu et al yang et al the latter of which
lacks residual organics and the continuous influx of mixed com 
munities of microorganisms to our knowledge there have been no
studies that specifically examine the effect of srt separate from
nutrient loading effects on mixed phototrophic communities in
suspended growth systems treating secondary effluent limiting
our ability to design effective and reliable phototrophic tertiary
treatment systems 

as the field seeks to engineer systems that achieve reliable and
predictive behavior there is a critical need to understand how
design and operational decisions such as hrt and srt influence the
complex phototrophic communities present in suspended growth
systems and in turn how these communities affect nutrient and
carbon dynamics the full complexity of phototrophic systems e
which consist of eukaryotic microalgae phototrophic bacteria i e 
cyanobacteria and chemotrophic bacteria both heterotrophs and
autotrophs e has only just begun to be explored e g cho et al 
 mark ibekwe et al and we have limited under 
standing of the selective pressures that operating parameters
 including srt have on community structure and overall system
performance studies that have examined algal community ecology
in wastewater systems have often relied on microscopy park et al 
 and have occasionally applied high throughput sequencing
techniques e g illumina sequencing cho et al mark
ibekwe et al which have been otherwise widely utilized in
wastewater studies e g purkhold et al however the use
of high throughput sequencing with eukaryotic algal communities
and in particular the application of sequencing methods to
eukaryotic microalgae in wastewater has lagged far behind that of
bacterial and archaeal applications bradley et al previous
studies have mostly been used to identify dominant organisms xu
et al and until recently relied on suboptimal primer sets that
represent algal community structure with a large degree of error
 discussed in detail in bradley et al 

the objective of this work was to examine the specific effect of
srt isolated from nutrient loading effects on mixed phototrophic
community structure and nutrient recovery in suspended growth
systems used for tertiary treatment to this end we apply high 
throughput sequencing techniques using improved eukaryotic
primers bradley et al along with well established bacterial
primers to provide clear quantitative evidence regarding commu 
nity diversity and dynamics as a function of srt three flat panel
pbrs were operated at distinct srts and days using
actual secondary effluent for long term operation srts after
reaching steady state all biomass was then mixed and redis 
tributed across reactors and long term operation was repeated to
evaluate the strength of srt as a selective pressure in driving
community structure and overall system performance in addition
to examining the algal and bacterial community membership and
abundance we examine the overall nutrient recovery focused on
total nitrogen tn and specific nutrient dynamics nh þ no � no � 
po � driven by srt and community structure ultimately inte 
grating an understanding of community structure dynamics in
phototrophic systems along with metrics and drivers of process
performance is key to enabling the design of systems that reliably
recover n and p from a given wastewater 

 materials and methods

 photobioreactor pbr design and operation

long term experimentation was done using flat panel pbrs as
described in detail in by gardner dale and colleagues gardner 
dale et al briefly l working volume pbrs with a short
light path thickness of mm were operated with continuous
flow i e as chemostats and subjected to a day night cycle of h
light and h dark representative of summer daylight hours in

strated a net increase in ph during daylight hours and thus ph
control via co addition was adequate all experimentation was
performed in a temperature controlled laboratory with ambient
air temperature of e �c and stable reactor temperature
conditions at ± �c 

 secondary effluent and examination of srt effects

reactors were operated at an srt hrt of and days 
consistent with past photobioreactor experiments that achieved
reliable performance e g gardner dale et al and in the
range of typical biological treatment processes rittmann and
mccarty tchobanoglous et al secondary effluent
was collected weekly from the local wwtp urbana il usa e
which predominantly treats municipal wastewater e and stored in
the dark at �c before and during use as photobioreactor influent 
srt and hrt were not physically separated and thus were the
same in order to examine the effect of growth rate governed by
srt on system performance the daily nutrient loading was set at a
fixed rate across all reactors and srts following the method of
mindl and colleagues mindl et al and gardner dale and
colleagues gardner dale et al by keeping nutrient loading
constant differences in community function and structure may be
attributed to srt and growth rate rather than nutrient loading
effects caused byhrt mindl et al across all reactors daily
nutrient loading was fixed at mg n l� d� and mg 
p l� d� which is equivalent to a typical secondary effluent
 mccarty et al assuming an algal system hrt of approxi 
mately day the raw secondary effluent contained mg 
n l� and mg p l� tp mg as po � and had bod of
 e mg l� in order to achieve consistent loading across srts 
the concentrations of total nitrogen and orthophosphate of the
secondary effluent were measured immediately after collection 
and each srt s medium was amended with nh cl to and
 mg n l� for srts of and days respectively and
k hpo to and mg p l� for srts of and days 
respectively to achieve the fixed daily n and p loadings final stock
concentrations of n and p were primarily in the form of nh þ and

effluent for each srt was also amended with micronutrients ac 
cording to a modified tap media with improved trace metals

ering capacity 

 inoculum and pbr start up period

biomass samples for inoculation of long term cultivation ex 
periments were collected locally urbana il usa from four
different sources to capture a variety of bacterial and algal com 
munities and to ensure a large diversity of microorganisms were
subjected to selective pressures primary and secondary
clarifier weirs at a local wwtp urbana il a pilot scale
algaewheel® system treating swine manure and a eutrophic
lake biomass from each location was strained through a mm
mesh screen to remove macroalgae and then mixed in equal pro 
portions by cell count neglecting biovolume performed via fluo 
rescence light microscopy x magnification before being
distributed among each of three parallel reactors an initial accli 
mation period of two weeks was designed to limit the loss of
species due to washout while transitioning the inoculum to labo 
ratory conditions pbrs were operated in batch mode under
nutrient replete conditions for seven days to increase culture
density and to retain species diversity and continuous light in 
tensity was gradually increased from to peak intensity
 me m� s� to allow culture acclimation at the end of day
seven the three reactors were mixed together re strained and
redistributed back into the three pbrs and srt separation was
initiated pbrs were operated for another seven days with srt
separation and diurnal light to begin selection for distinct com 
munities all cultures were then mixed together redistributed and
long term experimentation was initiated 

 long term pbr operation and sampling

long term experimentation was performed in two phases in
phase reactors were inoculated and run in parallel at different
srts and days with a fixed nutrient loading section 
each reactor was run for srts until reaching a steady state as
defined by a less than change in total suspended solids tss and
volatile suspended solids vss over three consecutive days after
the three reactors achieved steady state biomass from all three
reactors were combined strained and mixed in equal proportions
by mass tss and then redistributed across three clean reactors
and long term experimentation repeated as phase this replicate
run of each srt in series i e phase followed by phase was
performed to evaluate the strength of srt as a selective pressure
and to more deeply examine microbial community divergence and
stability across srts all reactors srt and days were again
operated for srts until steady state was achieved 

during each phase water quality and biomass samples were
taken to determine solids concentrations total and volatile n and
p effluent concentrations and community composition micro 
scopy and dna analysis samples were taken more frequently at
the start of experimentation to capture system startup dynamics
 see table s for detailed sample schedule samples were taken h
prior to the end of the light cycle when algal carbon reserves and
nutrient uptake has been shown to be at its peak gardner dale
et al briefly ml aliquots of mixed liquor were
removed from each reactor ml of which was used for tss and
vss analysis and ml of which was centrifuged at �g for
 min ml of the resulting supernatant was filtered through
 mm pvdf filters emd millipore ma usa before freezing
at � �c until analysis and the remaining ml of supernatant
was returned to the reactors to minimize the effect of sampling on
reactor operation pelleted biomass was stored at � �c prior to
lyophilization and storagewith desiccant before elemental analysis 

 kinetic assay

at the end of phase and phase when steady state had been
achieved a portion of the biomass was removed from each reactor
to observe themaximum specific uptake rates of n and p in order to
gain insight into the intrinsic i e maximum potential uptake rates
by the microbial community and differentiate them from the extant
rates i e actual rates already seen under steady state conditions
 grady jr et al kinetic assays were performed using peak
light intensity and nutrient replete conditions consistent with past
work guest et al briefly the biomass was placed in

identical reactors i e same photobioreactors as continuous oper 
ation with secondary effluent and ph control and spiked with
 mg n l� as nh cl and mg p l� as k hpo to ensure
nutrient availability would not limit observed nutrient uptake rates

exposed to continuous light and operated in batch mode to deter 
mine themaximum specific i e vss normalized uptake rates of n
and p as mg nutrient g vss� d� guest et al with sam 
pling occurring approximately every h during the first h when
rates were at a maximum although internal nutrient stores can
reduce the maximum observed rates of n and p uptake bougaran
et al no effort was made to deplete existing reserves prior
to batch experimentation in order to expedite the transition from
continuous operation to batch uptake measurements reducing
time for community structure shift each reactor was monitored
for changes in biomass composition and microbial community via
microscopy and because maximum specific uptake rates were
observed within the first e h of batch operation changes in
community structure were expected to be limited at the time of
intrinsic parameter estimation however srt e phase data
showed significant changes in the community structure at the end
of days and these data were excluded

 results and discussion

 microbial community structure

long term operation of mixed community reactors demon 
strated that distinct eukaryotic communities assemble across srts
 fig phase fig s phase and that diversity decreased with
increasing srt mean relative abundance of otus present at steady 
state operation did not depend on initial concentration of the otus
in the inoculum when examining the top ten otus present in each
reactor representing a total of otus across all three reactors it
was observed that only nine of the total otus were also
prevalent i e contribute to the top of mean relative abun 
dance in the inocula sources additionally the inocula showed
high richness and diversity for the community as a whole average
across all four sources of inocula sobs¼ dnpshannon¼ 
following the start up period in which cultures were acclimated to
laboratory conditions and lighting selection of specific commu 
nities in response to srt was observed after approximately days 
rare otus including those that showed limited or no representa 
tion in sequencing data from the inocula were present at steady 
state operation although the effect of influent community mem 
bers on long term community structural dynamics in microbial
processes needs additional study the otus seen at steady state
here related more closely with the initial inoculum after acclima 
tion fig w than to those otus present in influent media
 secondary effluent see also figs s es and the presence of
influent microbial species on steady state community structure
appears to be minimal this underscores the importance of selec 
tive environments e conditions within the reactor which favor a
particular species or function out of many rittmann and mccarty 
 e which have in general been leveraged in algal systems
 mooij et al excluding events such as species die off and
invasion initial inoculum concentrations and the general propor 
tion of species present at the start should not influence the pres 
ence and abundance of species at steady state this is especially
evident when comparing cyanobacterial otus in which the most
prevalent cyanobacterial otu otu pseudanabaena sp fig is
found in appreciable concentrations in all three reactors over time
 mean relative abundance of total bacterial diversity on average
 and respectively despite only being found in the
inocula at less than of the total mean relative read abundance
in s rrna gene data 

sequencing data fig along with microscopy sm fig s 
show that srt operating at the fastest growth rate was domi 
nated by filamentous eukaryotes and cyanobacteria such as
pseudanabaena sp on the other hand srt was dominated by
unicellular and colonial green algae such as chlamydomonas sp and
acutodesmus sp respectively for full taxonomy of both phase and
phase for eukaryotes v and v v variable region and bacteria
 v v variable region see sm fig s through fig s srt 
operating between the two displayed a mixture of filamentous and
unicellular algae and cyanobacteria biomass was deep green in
color and the majority of observed cells had green pigmentation 
this along with sequencing data in which cyanobacteria often
represented a significant fraction of s rrna gene sequences 
confirmed that the microbial community was dominated by pho 
totrophic organisms small unicellular algae such as those seen in
srt often exhibit fast growth rates and more competitive
nutrient utilization than larger cells jakob o nalley maria
stockenreiter shurin et al and typically dominate
conventional microalgal systems e g hrap systems de godos
et al park et al however filamentous microalgae
and cyanobacteria such as those seen in srt have been shown to
maintain a strong dominance under wash out pressure due to their
high settleability hu et al here filamentous eukaryotes and
cyanobacteria are selected at low srt due to a combination of fast
growth rates high settling efficiency and attached growth ten 
dencies genera present in all reactors are among those commonly
found in phototrophic wastewater treatment processes mark
ibekwe et al park et al roberts et al and are
likely to be found across locations and climates that utilize pho 
totrophic microorganisms for treatment 

srt also resulted in distinct differences in algal community
richness and abundance with a short srt resulting in a more dy 
namic and diverse community while a longer srt promotes otu
dominance and community structural stability although some
dominant eukaryotic otus e g otu were shared between all
reactors there is a clear variation in diversity i e community
membership and abundance across srts with srt demon 
strating high diversity both in terms of species richness and
abundance and srt being dominated by only a few otus in
total for eukaryotes otus contribute to the top of mean
relative read abundance for srt compared to otus for srt 
and otus for srt cyanobacterial abundance is also concen 
trated in a few otus for all srts fig e cyanobacteria with the
top otus contributing and of total bacterial
mean relative abundance across the three reactors four alpha 
diversity metrics were calculated richness based metrics
observed otus sobs and the chao estimator rchao and
structure based metrics which account for both species richness

munity diversity srt has x the richness sobs¼ and di 
versity dnpshannon¼ of that present at higher srts srt

non¼ and across reactors and respectively 
in all reactors bacterial richness was x higher than that of
eukaryotic richness a trend that became stronger with increasing
srt because bacterial richness stayed relatively constant while
eukaryotic richness decreased with increasing srt the question of
srt effect on microbial diversity has been a matter of debate 
although rarely addressed in the literature chen et al 
akarsubasi et al hypothesized that increasing srt would lead to
increased bacterial diversity akarsubasi et al which might
be expected due to niche differentiation and longer srts that favor
organisms which utilize scarce resources i e k strategists vuono

et al although experimentation showed only weak support
for this with diversity remaining nearly the same across srts an
observation also seen in another study bagchi et al in
contrast saikaly et al explicitly measured the effect of srt on the
bacterial diversity of activated sludge systems and found that short
srts were associated with higher diversity saikaly et al 
this effect has also been seen in other wastewater treatment pro 
cesses which have shown lower microbial diversity in processes
which use longer srts over shorter ones e g hu et al silva
et al overall the data presented here demonstrate a
consistent and reproducible relationship between srtand diversity
for the eukaryotic algal community with diversity decreasing with



i m bradley et al water research e 
increasing srt a finding that is consistent with previous studies
that have examined bacterial diversity only hu et al saikaly
et al silva et al in contrast there was no change in
diversity across srt for the bacterial communities in this study 

the presence of bacteria that are central to wastewater treat 
ment such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite 
oxidizing bacteria nob were also found over long term opera 
tion and increased over time and with increasing srt all otus
belonging to the aob were identified as being in the genus nitro 
somonas while otus belonging to the nob were identified as
nitrospira fig e nitrifying bacteria it is worth noting that
although all nob present in the system belonged to the genus
nitrospira not all nitrospira are nob and this genus represents nob
and comammox cmx daims et al pinto et al van
kessel et al the highest concentration of nitrosomonas
sp occurred in srt during the last srt of operation 
although srt also had a consistent presence of nitrosomonas sp 
 average nitrospira sp were slightly less abundant reaching
peak totals between and of the total bacterial diversity 
nitrosomonas sp was present within the range commonly seen in
wastewater treatment e kim et al layton et al 
 and nitrospira were at concentrations similar to those
seen by kim and colleagues in a full scale activated sludge process
 kim et al somewhat surprisingly nitrobacter sp 
was not detected despite being commonly found in wastewater
treatment siripong and rittmann however nitrospira are
more frequently the dominant nob in activated sludge systems
 burrell et al juretschko et al siripong and rittmann 
 although only detected in one inoculum source secondary
effluent and not detected during the first days of long 
term experimentation nitrospira increased in concentration over
time and resulted in mean relative abundances of and
 across the three srts the presence of nitrifying organisms at
longer srts is not surprising with aob and nob being slow
growers and with wastewater processes that utilize these organ 
isms usually operating at day srts tchobanoglous et al 

 community dynamics

beta diversity measurements including the membership based
 presence absence jaccard djaccard and structure based bray 
curtis dbraycurtis dissimilarity show community membership
and structure of each microbial community changes through time 
and that these differences are less prominent at higher srts pcoa
plots of phase fig a top and phase fig a bottom 
demonstrate that all communities shifted away from the initial
starting community inocula mixture t¼ and toward a steady 
state community fig a circled data points in phase srt 
was the most dissimilar to the initial inoculum dbray 
curtis¼ ± srt remained the most similar dbray 
curtis¼ ± and srt was in between
 dbraycurtis¼ ± however after mixing all biomass in
equal proportions bymass for the replicate run section srt 
remained stable and stayed within a dissimilarity of ± 
while srt and srt communities again diverged from the initial
mixed community and reached a new steady state community that
diverged more substantially from the initial community dbray 
curtis¼ ± and dbraycurtis¼ ± respectively in
all cases during phase divergence from the initial community
may have been somewhat muted due to loss of diversity over long 
term experimentation and all communities showed less diver 
gence during phase than during phase this may be attributed to
selective environments and competition over longer time scales
that reduced diversity at the community level i e inter species
diversity and at the species level i e intra species and trait
diversity nonetheless these results show the highest stability for
srt which after establishing itself during phase changes little
during phase even after mixing with the other dominant species
present in srt and srt furthermore srt and have
markedly different steady state communities between phase and
phase dbraycurtis¼ ± and dbraycurtis¼ ± 
compared to srt dbraycurtis¼ ± to normalize the
results to a common stage of operation i e number of srts we
also examined the dissimilarity with inocula after six srts of
operation for each reactor fig c after which communities were
operating at steady state the dissimilarities at this time point
reflect the same relationships seen over the length of the full
experiment and when comparing as time series days 

these results demonstrate that longer srts result in more stable
communities while shorter srts result in less stable or conversely 
more dynamic communities unstable environments such as
those seen in srt or those that undergo perturbation events are
more likely to contain fast growing organisms that have high
resource utilization i e ‘r strategists’ pianka furthermore 
vuono and colleagues were able to show srt may be leveraged to
impose an r k selection on organisms in wastewater treatment 
short srts selected for fast growing r strategists while longer srts
selected for organisms that efficiently utilized scarce resources i e 
‘k strategists’ vuono et al however community stability
and functional stability appear to be decoupled and communities
with unpredictable structural dynamics may reach a dynamic
equilibrium characterized by stable function and dynamic com 
munity structure kaewpipat and grady kooi et al 
furthermore given that short srts have increased microalgal di 
versity these communities are likely to be more functionally
redundant and thus more resistant to perturbations resulting in
more reliable treatment in contrast long srts although con 
taining a more stable community have less diversity and may be
more prone to disruption i e loss of system performance 

 community function and performance

nutrient recovery via biomass assimilation was highest at low
srts with increasing srt leading to more stable nitrification but
increased variability in tn removal and higher effluent nutrient
concentrations tn and po � overall srt had higher concen 
trations of tn sm fig s than srt in both phase and phase 
largely due to the accumulation of no � srt consistently main 
tained higher steady state tn removal across phases average
 fig a whereas srt and srt showed more variable
performance with tn removal ranging from to for srt 
 average figs b and e for srt average 
fig c at steady state i e despite stable biomass concentrations 
in terms of phosphorus removal trends were less distinct with
average removals in phases and of and srt 
 and srt and and srt respec 
tively fig s although a co occurrence network analysis sm 
section s found no strong correlations between specific otus and
nutrient removal these results support the conclusion that longer
srts result in a more stable community structure whereas short
srts have more dynamic communities with increased functional
stability related to tn removal but not orthophosphate removal 

although microalgae prefer nh þ as a n source because it is
already reduced to the form used for cellular metabolism oxidation

no � richmond kinetic studies performed after each mixed
community had reached steady state demonstrated that the
removal of n by microalgae and bacteria followed the anticipated
preferential succession e g fig with nh þ being removed first

state of þ see fig and s for all kinetic data while some

n l� no � became the primary n source for the algae the
amount of nh þ that was oxidized to no � as seen in the initial
increase of no � indicates that the primary mechanism of nh þ

removal was due to nitrification while the primary removal of no �

was due to algal biomass assimilation the uptake of nutrients can
be modeled separately from growth droop which is an

i m bradley et al water research e 
approach that has been adopted in recent wastewater relevant
algal process models lee et al the form of nitrogen
assimilated also influences ph fuggi et al and the reducing
equivalents needed for assimilation fuggi et al guest et al 
 sanz luque et al which underscores the need to
independently model the fate of each nitrogen specie including 
perhaps reduced nitrogen no � and no � as well as interactions
among multiple limiting nutrients bougaran et al the
maximum observed net removal rates of each n species fig b for
nh þ no � and no � reached ± ± and
 ± mg n g vss� d� after phase experimentation 
although additional research is required to better characterize the
intrinsic kinetic capabilities of mixed microalgal cultures relevant
to wastewater taking into account nutrient reserves community
structure shifts over time etc these data suggest similar rates of n
removal may be achievable regardless of n speciation these find 
ings highlight the potential that algal bacterial communities may
have for reliable nutrient recovery fromwastewaters across a range
of n fractionation 

given that p and n uptake are linked through biomass uptake to
grow and establish internal nutrient reserves the ratio of n p
removal can be examined to better understand how design de 
cisions and community structure influence effluent orthophos 
phate concentrations gardner dale et al geider and roche 
 n p ratio of an individual species has been previously shown
to linearly decrease with increasing srt as cell structural re 
quirements change with growth rate gardner dale et al 
this relationship is known as the growth rate hypothesis sterner
and elser at the same time n p ratio also varies across in 
dividual species and the overall n p ratio in mixed communities
may not change linearly with growth rate as community structure
may be distinct across srts n p ratios across srt were not
consistently monotonic fig s but variability in n p ratio be 
tween experiments did change with srt srt demonstrated the
largest difference between phase ± g n g p� and phase
 ± g n g p� average steady state n p mass ratios
 fig s in sm while srt achieved a more consistent n p ratio
 ± for phase ± for phase likely due to its more
stable community structure the higher richness and diversity of
srt however may allow for a plasticity in n p uptake that is able
to respond to changes in n and p loading resulting from fluctuating
influent concentrations as well as internal nutrient cycling e g via
cell death in natural systems there has been emerging consensus
that diversity promotes system productivity and functional stability
 cardinale et al ptacnik et al shurin et al and
ptacnik and colleagues in particular showed in a large scale
sampling study that diversity drives functional stability among
phytoplankton communities by fostering resource use efficiency 
consistent with this observation but in our engineered system 
srt demonstrated more stable ecological function i e nutrient
recovery across phases despite having very different communities
during each phase dbraycurtis¼ ± furthermore if sub 
jected to perturbation events such as the introduction of invasive
predators or toxic shocks it is reasonable to expect low diversity
communities like those seen in srt to be particularly vulner 
able to collapse while the diversity of srt could afford a
robustness and resiliency that is more likely to dampen perfor 
mance impacts and support more rapid recovery this hypothesis
warrants testing through future research given that performance
reliability will be critical to full scale adoption of intensive algal
processes 

overall there is a tradeoff between the type of n removal across
srt longer srts promote stable bacterial nitrification and the
removal of nh þ while shorter srts promote biomass growth and
the assimilation of n in all forms by microalgae to achieve lower
effluent n given that srt also has an influence on microalgal
community membership and abundance low srt may be lever 
aged as a process control to select for increased biomass growth
rates and increased eukaryotic diversity which may promote
functional stability and achieve more effective and reliable total
nutrient removal via biomass assimilation this short srt strategy
represents a paradigm shift in our approach to removing n via
bacterial nitrification denitrificationwhich leverages slow growing
bacteria i e aob nob and cmx and archaea ammonia oxidizing
archaea aoa dimitri kits et al tchobanoglous et al 
ultimately the use of srt e an intuitive parameter that wrrf
operators have successfully employed in conventional biological
treatment processes e may provide algal technologies with an
accessible way to shape community structure and function and to
obtain reliable and predictable nutrient recovery fromwastewaters 



i m bradley et al water research e 
 conclusions

the specific effect of srt i e growth rate effects on mixed
phototrophic community structure and nutrient recovery was
examined in suspended growth systems used to treat secondary
effluent improved high throughput sequencing techniques were
used to examine both algal and bacterial community structure 
diversity and dynamics over long term experimentation it was
found that srt influenced community composition significantly 
creating a gradient of microbial composition across srts as ex 
pected a short srt days selected for dynamic fast growing
communities while a longer srt days allowed for the prolif 
eration of slow growers and stable nitrification however eukary 
otic community diversity was also significantly affected by srt and
diversity community richness and evenness decreased with
increasing srt this resulted in stable communities at high srts
that reliably removed nh þ but experienced more variable overall
nutrient uptake and higher levels of effluent tn conversely dy 
namic less stable algal communities present at low srt were
highly diverse andmaintained consistent overall tn removal across
different community structures and dominant organisms in prac 
tice these results demonstrate that utilities seeking to leverage
algal systems for nutrient removal via biomass assimilation may
want to consider short srts that allow for greater biomass assim 
ilation and functional resiliency as the field seeks to design and
implement microalgal processes at full scale the control of srt
independent of hrt may be an important selective pressure to help
maintain community structure and overall system performance
