abstract in soil the link between microbial diversity and carbon transformations
is challenged by the concept of functional redundancy here we hypothesized that
functional redundancy may decrease with increasing carbon source recalcitrance and
that coupling of diversity with c cycling may change accordingly we manipulated
microbial diversity to examine how diversity decrease affects the decomposition of
easily degradable i e allochthonous plant residues versus recalcitrant i e autoch 
thonous organic matter c sources we found that a decrease in microbial diversity i 
affected the decomposition of both autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources 
thereby reducing global co emission by up to and ii shaped the source of
co emission toward preferential decomposition of most degradable c sources our
results also revealed that the significance of the diversity effect increases with nu 
trient availability altogether these findings show that c cycling in soil may be more
vulnerable to microbial diversity changes than expected from previous studies par 
ticularly in ecosystems exposed to nutrient inputs thus concern about the preser 
vation of microbial diversity may be highly relevant in the current global change

significance for organic matter decomposition a major process on which rely many of

biodiversity enhances ecosystem stability and productivity this assumption hasbeen broadly verified for plant communities thanks to the vast body of evidence
from more than years of studies most of which were based on the manipulation
of taxonomic diversity and or diversity of functional groups – compared to plant
ecology microbial ecology is still lacking demonstrations of the relationship between
biodiversity and function consequently while it is widely recognized that
microorganisms perform a crucial role in many key ecosystem functions involved in soil

changes and land management – on microbial diversity in soil ecosystems is
considered 

with hundreds of thousands of taxa per gram of soil microbial diversity dominates
soil biodiversity due to this enormous diversity functional redundancy within the
soil microbial component is assumed to be very high so high in fact that it is still
widely assumed that community diversity and composition are decoupled from func 
tioning nevertheless functional redundancy may vary between the numerous
processes driven by soil microorganisms more precisely processes carried out by
small pools of microbial species might be more affected by changes in diversity than
processes involving large numbers of microbial taxa within the soil microbial
community the decomposition of organic matter is one of the most redundant
functions since most soil microorganisms can be broadly grouped as heterotrophs 
such high redundancy was evidenced by several studies which reported that microbial
diversity had no influence on a global estimation of organic matter decomposition
based on total co release however total co release integrates a large range
of emission sources ranging from labile to recalcitrant c organic compounds and the
enzymatic capacities required to degrade recalcitrant compounds compared to more
labile c compounds are provided by only a small pool of microbial species 
this suggests that functional redundancy may decrease with increasing carbon source
recalcitrance and that coupling of diversity with c cycling may change accordingly as
a result modifications in microbial diversity may not necessarily affect the intensity of
the broad co flux itself but rather the composition of this flux in terms of the
relative contributions of co emitted from labile versus recalcitrant c sources studies
providing such evidence should be highly relevant to predicting how much the current
impact of anthropogenic activities and of climate changes on soil microbial diversity is
likely to affect the carbon balance in soil 

the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changes in microbial diversity
 bacteria and fungi on the decomposition of different c substrates in soil we hypoth 
esized that a decrease in microbial diversity would have less effect on the decompo 
sition of allochthonous easily degradable c sources than on more recalcitrant autoch 
thonous c sources to test this hypothesis we took advantage of the particularities of
the soil microbial component i e microscopic size and high growth rates which make
it a highly suitable model that is easy to manipulate for testing a diversity function
hypothesis under controlled conditions we simulated an erosion of soil microbial
diversity by using a dilution to extinction approach in a microcosm experiment 
this approach has advantages over other possible ways of manipulating diversity such
as community construction in that i it allows manipulation irrespective of the
cultivability of the microbial species and ii it leads to the establishment of highly
complex communities composed of several hundreds of different species which is
realistic with regard to the huge genetic diversity that characterizes the soil microbial
world c labeled wheat residues were used as allochthonous carbon input to distin 
guish the relative contributions of mineralization from allochthonous c co and
autochthonous c co carbon sources according to microbial diversity

decrease in bacterial diversity along the dilution gradient and better evenness in the
most species rich communities as observed between d and the native community 
the decrease of evenness along the diversity gradient was associated with an increase
in the dominance of otus affiliated to beta and gammaproteobacteria and a decrease
of acidobacteria actinobacteria planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes chloroflexi and
deltaproteobacteria fig a 

the diversity metrics of the fungal communities in the native and the most species 
rich community d were similar table composition at the phylum level was
slightly different mainly due to an increase of ascomycota and a decrease of basidi

richness which decreased significantly p � by and in d and d

this was mainly due to the increased dominance of otus affiliated to basidiomycota
over ascomycota along the diversity gradient fig b 

the complexity of the microbial community bacteria and fungi was lower in d 
than in the native community as evidenced by the values of the microbial cooccur

of fungal links contributing to the network as indicated above for the diversity metrics

the release of c co i e c co emitted through mineralization of the autoch 
thonous carbon source was also significantly stimulated compared to the control level 
following wheat residue incorporation this pointed to a priming effect pe of native
soil organic matter which also contributed significantly to the increased c co release
observed in amended microcosms fig b this pe occurred at all the three diversity
levels but its intensity was significantly and positively related to the diversity of the soil
microbial community p � fig b at the end of the incubation pe represented

was also dependent on the diversity level ranging from � mg g� for d to
 � mg g� for d and � mg g� for d this indicated that for a
given quantity of c wheat residue mineralized the quantity of c co released through
pe increased with increasing soil microbial diversity 

in amended microcosms microbial diversity also impacted the composition of total
co flux in terms of the relative contribution of c co emitted from allochthonous
wheat residues versus an autochthonous carbon source fig and table s most
markedly the contribution of c co emitted from wheat residues was significantly
higher in the species poor communities in d and d than in d up to weeks 

discussion
community manipulation decreased microbial diversity in soil the aim of our

study was to evaluate the effect of microbial diversity on carbon transformations in soil 
to this end we manipulated experimentally the diversity of a soil microbial community
using a dilution to extinction approach 

compared to the native community the fungal community that established in the
highest diversity level d harbored similar characteristics in terms of richness and
complexity in contrast and despite the high values of diversity indices the diversity of
the bacterial community was lower in d than in the native community this decrease
was explained by a lower abundance of phyla reported to be mainly composed of

slow growing organisms such as acidobacteria actinobacteria planctomycetes chloro 
flexi and gemmatimonadetes – and an increased dominance of particular pop 
ulations described as fast growing r strategists mainly affiliated to proteobacteria
 mostly the alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria subclasses of proteobacte 
ria and firmicutes – altogether the shifts in diversity observed between the d 
and the native communities highlighted the finding that colonization impacted the
bacterial community more than the fungal community the observed changes are
in agreement with the commonly accepted idea that bacteria are generally more
opportunistic than fungi due to differences in physiology and metabolic capacities
 

the dilution to extinction approach was successful in establishing gradients of
bacterial and fungal diversity among the three diversity levels with d � d � d 
 table it was clearly apparent that the decreased diversity could be ascribed to a loss
of the least abundant i e rare species at the moment of dilution as evidenced by the
richness index which was decreased by and for bacteria and by and 
for fungi in d and d respectively compared to levels in d however the ecological
attributes of the inoculated populations may also have determined the fitness of these
populations during soil colonization and hence determined the diversity of the finally
established community this may explain why the differences between the three
diversity levels did not simply result from the arithmetic loss of microbial populations
due to dilution more precisely the decrease of evenness observed for bacterial
and fungal communities along the diversity gradient highlighted the finding that
dilution led to the increased dominance of a particular subset of microbial populations
at the end of colonization in agreement with previous studies however the
composition of the established communities suggested that the mechanisms that
determined the success of the microbial populations in colonizing the soil differed
between bacteria and fungi 

for bacteria evenness was decreased along the gradient due to the increased
dominance of the most opportunistic fast growing r strategists over the slower 
growing populations interestingly the same phyla were involved as the phyla dis 
cussed above that differed between the native and d communities this suggests
that the growth rate may have been the main determinant of the success of bacterial
populations during soil colonization in contrast for fungi the decrease of evenness was
mainly associated with an increased dominance of basidiomycota over ascomycota 
both phyla are reported to be major contributors to c cycling in soil however 
basidiomycota are assumed to possess improved metabolic capacities over ascomycota
for decomposing more recalcitrant soil c compounds accordingly our results
suggest that the success of the fungal populations during the colonization phase may
have been determined more by their metabolic abilities than by their growth rates it
is noticeable that this difference in colonization strategy between bacteria and fungi
led to an increase in the relative importance of fungi in determining the properties of
the microbial network in the inoculated soils as evidenced by the decrease in the ratio
of the numbers of bacterial to fungal links in d d and d 
compared to the ratio in the native community however in our study this did
not impact labile carbon availability in the three diversity levels based on the size of the
dissolved organic carbon pool as estimated by applying the method of guigue et al 
 at t the carbon pools were similar for d � �g g� soil d � 
�g g� soil and d � �g g� soil 

in spite of large differences in terms of the levels of bacterial and fungal diversity 
the microbial biomasses and densities at t were similar for all three diversity levels fig 
 this indicated that after inoculation the microbial communities developed until the
soil carrying capacity was attained which was not dependent on the diversity
of the soil microbial community the microbial biomass in the controls remained stable
throughout the experiment but was similarly increased by the addition of wheat
residues in all three diversity levels the possibility that any further observed shifts in

respiration rates with dilution would be due to a community biomass effect could
therefore be excluded 

decrease in microbial diversity affects the decomposition of allochthonous and
autochthonous carbon sources high microbial diversity generally stimulated the
decomposition of both autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources fig and 
in the controls basal respiration i e autochthonous organic matter decomposition 
was not affected by the decrease of microbial diversity at the two highest diversity
levels d and d fig a in agreement with the functional redundancy hypothesis
 however respiration decreased by in the most species poor community d 
compared to that of d highlighting the limits of functional redundancy to buffer the
effect of diversity loss on ecosystem processes this was unexpected however 
since previous studies had not shown any impact of an even greater decrease in
microbial diversity on basal respiration this discrepancy with previously
published data may be attributed to our experimental design which included mechan 
ical mixing of the soil in the controls to mimic the disturbance associated with the
incorporation of wheat residues in amended microcosms mechanical disturbance is
known to release additional c substrates due to the disruption of soil aggregates and
hence to increase nutrient availability for microbes particularly during the first days
following the perturbation such a transitory increase of nutrient availability may
have contributed to the functional dissimilarity observed in the lowest diversity level
 d during the first week of incubation in agreement with van der heijden et al 
who proposed that the relationship between microbial diversity and ecosystem func 
tioning may differ between nutrient poor and nutrient rich ecosystems the impor 
tance of nutrient availability was verified in recent studies that reported an increase of
the diversity effect with increasing nutrient availability for denitrification or of microbial
stability following disturbance 

in our study an increase of the functional significance of microbial diversity with
increasing nutrient availability was further evidenced by the results obtained in wheat 
amended microcosms as expected c co release was increased following wheat
residue input corresponding to the input of an easily degradable c substrate 
which stimulated microbial biomass during the first weeks of incubation fig 
however whereas the increases in microbial biomass were similar at all three diversity
levels decreasing microbial diversity had a strong and highly significant effect on
decreasing c co emission in contrast to the above mentioned results obtained for
basal respiration no saturation effect was observed in amended microcosms since the
total c co released after days was decreased respectively by and in d 
and d compared to the d level fig a altogether our results indicate that
functional redundancy may have been overestimated and that c transformations in soil
may be more sensitive to microbial diversity changes than previously expected par 
ticularly in ecosystems exposed to nutrient inputs 

interestingly the difference in c co delta c co amounts released between the
controls and their respective amended treatments for each of the three diversity levels
increased with time fig b we suggest that this increase of functional dissimilarity
between the three diversity levels with time may in part be explained by i the
chemical and structural complexity of the allochthonous c source and ii the sequential
decomposition of the different components of wheat residues that occurred during the
degradation process from labile i e sugars to more recalcitrant i e lignin com 
pounds while the labile fraction of wheat residues provides easily available c and
energy sources for many microorganisms i e highly redundant function the cometa 
bolic nature of lignin breakdown depends on energy providing processes and requires
a specific set of enzymes and microbial populations i e weakly redundant function 
 accordingly during the first week of decomposition similar values of delta
c co were observed at all three diversity levels reflecting the availability and decom 
position of the most degradable wheat compounds after days the decrease of delta
c co observed in d and d compared to that of d may reflect the increased
recalcitrance of residues due to prior decomposition of the most degradable com

pounds hence requiring more specialized functions carried out by a less redundant
community and more likely to be represented in the most species rich community 
finally the gradient observed of d � d � d after days may be explained by the
subsequent increased recalcitrance of the remaining residues altogether these results
show that functional redundancy decreases with increasing carbon source recalci 
trance leading to an increased effect of biodiversity with time following allochthonous
c source inputs to our knowledge the dynamic of the diversity effect following an
allochthonous c source input has not been reported previously however it may be
highly relevant in the current global change context assumed to impact the pulse
inputs of plant residues and rhizodeposits into the soil 

in addition to co emitted from wheat decomposition the stimulation of autoch 
thonous carbon mineralization after wheat residue addition to the soil i e the priming
effect also contributed significantly to the increased co release in amended micro 
cosms fig b this was in agreement with numerous studies that reported a pe
following the incorporation of plant residues into the soil – however here we
provide the proof of concept that pe is positively dependent on microbial diversity
since it decreased along the diversity gradient fig b this diversity effect was highly
significant since autochthonous c mineralization was higher in d than in d in
addition to the amount of c co emitted through pe the efficiency of c wheat to
produce c co through pe increased with increasing microbial diversity and
 c unit were emitted per unit of c wheat mineralized in d d and d respec 
tively different microbial mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pe 
 however in our study involving an erosion of microbial diversity the differences in
pes and better efficiency observed according to diversity may be mainly explained by
an increased cometabolism process in species rich communities with autochthonous c
decomposers i e k strategist populations carrying a specific set of enzymes more
likely to be present in species rich communities and degrading recalcitrant soil organic
matter som compounds by using the allochthonous c source as energy source 

the dynamics of the ratio between c co released from allochthonous sources to
that from autochthonous c sources provided additional interesting information in this
sense fig according to our hypothesis the relative contribution of c co emitted
from the allochthonous c source was increased in the most depauperate communities
 d and d up to weeks after wheat residue incorporation into the soil indicating
that species poor communities preferentially decomposed the more degradable alloch 
thonous c sources rather than the autochthonous c source however after weeks 
similar values of this ratio were observed at all three diversity levels probably resulting
from the establishment of limiting conditions due to nutrient depletion and a higher
recalcitrance of the remaining residues which were becoming close to the recal 
citrance of the autochthonous c sources 

in our study based on the use of the dilution to extinction approach to manipulate
bacterial and fungal diversity it must be kept in mind that higher trophic level
organisms i e specialized predators like protozoa are likely to have been influenced
most by dilution because these organisms are less abundant in soil food webs 
more precisely considering that protozoa are present at an average density of g� 

soil in most soils they may have been weakly present in d dilution � compared
to their levels in d and d given the importance of these organisms for ecosystem
functions for a review see reference the loss of protozoa in addition to the erosion
of the fungal and bacterial diversity discussed above may have contributed to the
changes in c co emissions observed among the three diversity levels the loss of
protozoa may indeed possibly have decreased the availability of macronutrients in d 
through the decrease of the release of n by bacterivores and or the immobilization of
n in the microbial biomass due to lower stimulation of microbial activity and turnover 
hence limiting the mineralization of organic carbon 

this food web hypothesis may explain the slight decrease of mineralization ob 
served in d compared to that of the two other diversity levels in the controls 
however it cannot explain the gradient of mineralization observed following wheat

addition between d d and d despite the presence of protozoa in d and d in
addition it was globally estimated in a recent meta analysis that grazing decreases the
soil microbial biomass and bacterial abundance by and respectively in our
study neither the microbial biomass nor the bacterial density was decreased between
the three diversity levels suggesting that the grazing pressures were similar in the
three diversity levels in another respect our results show that the priming effect
decreased with the decrease in microbial diversity again this is not in agreement with
the food web hypothesis since a decrease in macronutrient availability would on the
contrary have increased the intensity of the pe due to stimulation of the nutrient 
mining mechanism that has been demonstrated to take place in cases of
nutrient depletion finally the hypothesis of a decrease of nutrient availability is not in
agreement with the decrease of the decomposition of lignin following the erosion of
diversity previously reported in the context of the same experiment limiting 
nitrogen conditions were on the contrary shown to induce ligninolytic activity 
altogether these elements highlight the finding that the decrease of mineralization
observed between d d and d was ascribed to the decrease of microbial diversity
rather than to the loss of higher trophic levels 

in conclusion our results demonstrate that c cycling in soil may be more vulnerable
to microbial diversity changes than expected from previous studies they indicate
mainly i that a decrease of soil microbial diversity affected the decomposition of both
autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources hence reducing global co emis 
sion i e emission from allochthonous and autochthonous sources by up to ii 
that this decrease in diversity modified the source of co emission toward preferential
decomposition of allochthonous c substrates and iii that the significance of the
diversity effect increases with nutrient availability altogether these highly relevant
new findings should be taken into account in future studies aiming to understand and
predict the functional consequences of decreased microbial diversity on soil ecosystem
services and carbon storage in soil particularly in the current context of global changes
assumed to impact both microbial diversity and the pulse inputs of plant residues and
rhizodeposits into the soil i e the functional significance of the microbial diversity
variable in predictive models of c turnover in soil will be increased with the increase of
c substrate availability the coupling of community diversity with ecosystem function 
ing also implies that concerns about the need to preserve biodiversity are also relevant
for soil microbial communities

blending for min at maximum speed it was serially diluted three levels of dilution of the soil
suspension were used as inocula to create a gradient of diversity i e undiluted d dilution

 d and dilution d the soil moisture was fixed at water holding capacity after inoculation 
the microcosms were closed to avoid air contamination and preincubated for weeks at °c i e 
average autumn temperature at the sampling site with weekly aeration and verification of soil water
content to allow colonization and stabilization of the inoculated communities in terms of density and
structure on day t after weeks of preincubation for each diversity level half of the microcosms
were amended with c labeled wheat residues dried ground to � mm atom c labeled 
incorporated at a rate of mg g� while the other half were not amended control the wheat residues
were homogeneously incorporated into the soil by mixing the soil in the control microcosms was also
mixed at t to avoid any bias due to the mixing step the soil microcosms were then incubated in the
dark at °c for days during incubation the soil moisture was maintained by replacing weight loss
with autoclaved reverse osmosis water when necessary in total there were microcosms correspond 
ing to treatments wheat amended versus control times levels of diversity times sampling dates
times replicates at t labile carbon availability was determined in triplicate microcosms for each
diversity level by quantifying the size of the dissolved organic carbon pool after extraction of the
water extractable organic matter by percolation at high pressure and temperature 

total and c co measurements at t t t t t t t t and t days of incubation the
gaseous phase of the microcosm was sampled in ml airtight flasks to measure the co concentration

an agilent gc system equipped with a pora plot q column and a thermal conductivity detector
coupled to an automatic sampler g headspace sampler agilent carbon isotopic enrichment was
determined by gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry gc irms using a trace gas

dna extraction from soil and molecular microbial biomass determination at t t t t and
t days of incubation dna was extracted from g of soil from all triplicate microcosms of each
treatment and diversity level and quantified as previously described dna was also extracted from
triplicates of native soil samples dna concentrations of crude extracts were determined by electropho 
resis in a agarose gel using a calf thymus dna standard curve and used as estimates of microbial
molecular biomass after quantification dna was purified using a minelute gel extraction kit

pyrosequencing of s and s rrna genes bacterial and fungal diversity was determined by 
pyrosequencing of ribosomal genes in the three replicates of each of the three diversity levels at t i e 
at the end of the weeks of preincubation and in three replicates of the native soil for bacterial
communities a s rrna gene fragment with sequence variability and the appropriate size about 
bases was amplified using the primers f and r for fungal communities an s rrna gene
fragment of about bases was amplified using the primers fr and ff primers and pcr
conditions were as described previously finally the pcr products were purified and quantified and
pyrosequencing was carried out on a gs flx titanium sequencing system roche 

taxonomic assignments and clustering of s and s rrna gene fragments bioinformatics
analyses were done with gns pipe developed by the genosol platform inra dijon france and
described previously first all reads were sorted according to the chosen multiplex identifiers then 
raw reads were filtered and deleted as follows i if the exact primers were not found both at the
beginning and end of the sequence ii if the sequences contained any ambiguity or iii if the sequence
length was below and bases for s and s reads respectively a perl program was then
applied to obtain strict dereplication the dereplicated reads were then aligned using infernal alignments
 and clustered into operational taxonomic units otu at sequence similarity using a perl
program that clusters rare reads to abundant ones and does not count differences in homopolymer
lengths main bias of pyrosequencing technologies another homemade filtering step was then applied
to eliminate potential sources of error e g pcr chimeras sequencing errors or otu overestimation 
based on taxonomic results to efficiently compare the data sets and avoid biased community compar 
isons high quality reads were rarefied by random selection closed to the lowest data sets and
 reads for s and s rrna gene sequences respectively kept reads were then compared for
taxonomy based analysis against the silva database version r using similarity approaches use 
arch finally diversity indexes were determined using the detected taxonomic groups at the genus
level the numbers of otus and the shannon h and evenness j indexes were used as indicators of
soil microbial richness diversity and structure respectively 

statistical analysis molecular biomass and diversity indexes were compared between the three
levels of diversity by applying a nonparametric kruskal wallis test for gaseous data statistical analyses
