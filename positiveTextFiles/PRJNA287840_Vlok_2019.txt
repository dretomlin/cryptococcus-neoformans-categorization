abstract charophyte algae not chlorophyte algae are the ancestors of ‘higher plants’ hence viruses
infecting charophytes may be related to those that first infected higher plants streamwaters from
british columbia canada yielded single stranded rna metagenomes of charavirus canadensis
 cv can that are similar in genomic architecture length nt nucleotide identity 
and encoded amino acid sequence identity to those of charavirus australis cv aus the
sequences of their rna dependent rna polymerases rdrp resemble those found in benyviruses 
their helicases those of hepaciviruses and hepegiviruses and their coat proteins cp those of
tobamoviruses all from the alphavirus flavivirus branch of the ‘global rna virome’ the ’ terminus
of the cv can genome but not that of cv aus is complete and encodes a methyltransferase domain 
comparisons of cp sequences suggests that canadian and australian charaviruses diverged – 
million years ago mya whereas the cps of charaviruses and tobamoviruses last shared a common
ancestor mya and the rdrps of charaviruses and benyviruses mya cv can is sporadically
abundant in low nutrient freshwater rivers in british columbia where chara braunii a close relative of
c australis occurs and which may be its natural host charaviruses like their hosts are ancient and
widely distributed and thus provide a window to the viromes of early eukaryotes and even archaea

 introduction

charophyte algae are the sister group of the chlorophyte green algae molecular genetics
indicates that they gave rise to higher plants – mya hence it is sensible to search for viruses
infecting extant charophytes as they may provide evidence of the virus lineages that infected the
earliest higher plants the discovery of sequences in metagenomic data from freshwaters in british
columbia canada that were homologous to those of a virus we call charavirus australis cv aus 
found in plants of chara australis in rivers of south eastern australia provided an opportunity
to compare charaviruses and their relatives in space and time in space because c australis is found
in south east asia and australasia but not in the americas and in time because they share two

viruses of 

genes with the tobamoviruses for which an age has recently been proposed allowing a wider
extrapolation of indicative dates 

cv aus was found in the s in plants of c australis a large charophyte growing in the
murrumbidgee river near canberra australia its virions were detected in sap from infected thalli by
electron microscopy and serology and stem cells of some infected thalli contained large paracrystals of
virions formed by cytoplasmic streaming and detected by polarized light microscopy and electron
microscopy no similar virions were subsequently found in a limited number of samples of
charophytes from other rivers in australia from rivers and lakes of central and southern england 
nor from a worldwide collection of live charophytes kept by v w proctor however two short
 and bp cv aus like contigs were reported from metagenomic data of samples collected in
the finger lakes ny usa confirming the presence of chara like viruses outside of australia 

cv aus has always appeared to be taxonomically anomalous its virions resemble those of
tobacco mosaic virus tmv with which it was originally grouped international committee in
taxonomy of viruses rd report in that they are straight helically constructed tubes nm wide and
with a similar pitch but they are significantly longer about nm in length rather than nm 
the cv aus genome is also commensurately longer than that of tmv around kb rather than the
 kb but was predicted to be kb as its ’terminus seemed incomplete the cv aus genome
encoded a kda replicase that has helicase protease and rdrp domains a kda helicase a 
kda movement protein and an kda capsid protein cp the last has significant sequence similarity
to the cps of tobamoviruses and hence the structural similarity of their virions whereas the replicase
shares predicted amino acid similarity with those of beny and hepeviruses and the helicase with
those of the helicases of hepaciviruses and hepegiviruses these unusual gene sequence relationships
make charaviruses a likely source of insights into the study of virus origins 

here we report on the assembly of rna virus metagenomic data from freshwaters near
vancouver british columbia that yielded the genome of a putative virus which we call charavirus
canadensis cv can which closely resembles cv aus through comparative genome analysis we
explore the evolutionary temporal biological and taxonomic relationships of these viruses and
use metagenomic analysis to infer the abundance and diversity of cv can in the environment our
analyses indicate that plants of other species in the genus chara are the likely host of cv can 

 materials and methods

viral rna metagenomic sequences were downloaded from the ncbi sequence read archive 
bioproject accession prjna these data were derived from samples collected from three
streams in southwestern british columbia over a month period a full account of the collection and
subsequent generation of the metagenomic data are described in –

 the cv can metagenome

a single stranded rna metagenome cv can accession code mk was assembled from
multiple lotic freshwater samples collected from southwestern british columbia the genome was

search of genbank found the sequence matched most closely throughout most of its length that of
cv aus accession code jf the cv aus genome is only nt daltons in length
with a g c content of and like that of cv can had a noticeably small guanine content 

the cv can sequence has four non overlapping open reading frames orfs that match in size
and order with those reported for cv aus figure except that the longest orf which encodes a
replicase rep and is adjacent to its ′ terminus is nt long of the metagenome whereas 
that of cv aus is only around nt this difference is because of an extra region at the ′ terminus
of the cv can sequence that encodes a putative viral methyltransferase v mtase domain which was
predicted to be missing from the incomplete ′ terminus of the cv aus sequence the three smaller
orfs are predicted to encode a helicase hel a possible movement protein mp and a virion coat
protein cp the concatenated orfs of cv can and cv aus had a mean nucleotide sequence identity

group is dominated by a crown group of rdrp proteins from avian and mammal hepeviruses thus 
the cv can replicase sequence matches the replicase sequence in cv aus as well as many other
more distantly related sequences in genbank from ‘environmental samples’ rather than cultured or

that from cv aus based on a blastp analysis and is more distantly related to helicase sequences of

sequence in cv aus indicating that they are the most evolutionarily conserved figure particularly
for amino acid residues – we were unable to identify ‘read contigs’ with alternative termini

 divergence of cv aus and cv can

molecular clock analysis of the cp was used to estimate the divergence times between charaviruses
and tobamoviruses based on the proposal that tobamoviruses are as old as their angiosperm hosts 
which are therefore estimated to have diverged around million years ago divergence dates
were estimated from the maximum likelihood ml tree of the rdrps and cps of the charaviruses
and tobamoviruses figures and assuming that patristic distances in the tree are linearly related
to evolutionary time for example the mean patristic distance between the cp of rattail cactus
necrosis associated virus and the other seven tobamoviruses i e the basal node of the tobamoviruses 
is − amino acid substitutions site aas s whereas the distance between the two
charavirus cps is aas s these distances suggest that the two charavirus cps diverged 
million years ago likewise the mean pairwise patristic distance between the two charavirus cps
and each of the eight tobamovirus cps is − aas s suggesting that the charavirus
and tobamovirus cp genes diverged million years ago the aligned cp sequences had several
indel rich regions resulting in an average of gaps in each sequence of the sites but when
the sequences were partitioned to remove the sites that contributed the most gaps leaving sequences
of aa with an average of gaps sequence they gave almost identical date estimates similar
calculations were used to date the rdrps supplementary table s 

cv aus and cv can genes have k mer patterns especially those of tetra nucleotides that are
distinct and place the charavirus rdrp and cp genes together and separate from the genes of other
sequence related viruses figure also the k mer patterns of the two charavirus helicases were
more similar to those of their rdrps than the two helicase like sequences ts and ts 
obtained from the freshwater lakes of new york state these patterns suggest see discussion that
cv can and cv aus infect closely related hosts charophytes but those from new york state may
have a different host to identify more specifically the likely host of cv can we melded two molecular
phylogenies of charophytes one based on the rbcl gene and the other the combined atpb psbc 
and rbcl genes this showed that c braunii which has been reported from british columbia is
the sister taxon of c australis figure a relationship that has and bootstrap support in the
separate taxonomies

protected watershed protec downstream from a reservoir fed from protec after passing through an
 km pipe protec and from a shallow stream approximately km from a residential neighbourhood

most distinct cv can was not detected in samples collected from three locations along a stream near
agricultural sites

calculated from rarefied read counts and normalized by contig size a suggest that cv can was most
abundant at the first protected site prist compared to the urban and agricultural agri sites single

 discussion

in this study we used metagenomic data collected from freshwater habitats in southwestern
british columbia to assemble the metagenome of a previously unknown single stranded ss rna
virus cv can with significant sequence similarity to a virus cv aus isolated from chara australis
growing in australia these data together with the report of metagenomic fragments of a third
possible charavirus population from lakes in new york state indicates that charaviruses may be
more widespread than previously thought 

all the significant features of cv can are shared with those reported for the genome of
cv aus the compositions lengths number and sizes of orfs and their predicted proteins are
similar but they differ significantly at the individual codon level the cps were most similar nt 
 aa identity and the mps least nt aa identity these identities are equivalent
to those of different tobamoviruses comparisons of tobamoviruses representing all species of the
genus found their cps had modal identities of nt range – and – aa range
 – whereas the cps of the closely related but distinct tobacco mosaic and tomato mosaic
viruses have nt and aas identity thus we conclude that cv can and cv aus represent
distinct species of a new proposed genus charavirus 

subak sharpe et al and hay and subak sharpe first showed that the nearest neighbour
nucleotide composition of the genomes of small viruses was closely similar to those of their hosts 
probably reflecting their adaptation to the transfer rna population of their hosts moreover 
kapoor et al showed that the mono and dinucleotide composition of rna virus genomes was
a useful predictor of their hosts’ kingdom or phylum probably for the same reason the similarity
between virus and host k mer patterns have further been validated in virus host systems 
we analyzed the k mer patterns from di nucleotide to septa nucleotides of the orfs of charaviruses
and their phylogenetic relatives including two published charavirus like helicase sequences here 
we report that the k mer patterns of the rdrp and cp genes of the charaviruses were more similar to
one another than to those of other phylogenetically related viruses suggesting that they have related
hosts and hence that the natural host of cv can is probably a charophyte 

the consistent linkage of the charavirus cps to a homolog isolated from a swimming crab beihai
charybdis crab virus is of interest this virus is possibly a contaminant rather than a virus of
charybdis crabs as although these crabs are opportunistic carnivores they do eat algae and
although most charophytes inhabit freshwater some also live in brackish water where they might
be eaten by crabs however in the k mer analyses the bccv cp did not group with the cv cps 
indicating that its host is probably not a charophyte 

the natural host of cv aus c australis has only been recorded from rivers in australia india 
malaysia new caledonia new zealand and taiwan but not the americas however two
molecular genetic studies of various charophytes including c australis were congruent and clarified
their phylogeny sakayama et al used rbcl sequences from chara spp and other charophytes 
whereas pérez et al combined atpb psbc and rbcl sequences from chara spp and other
charophytes both phylogenies found c braunii to be the sister taxon to c australis figure 
in contrast to c australis c braunii is cosmopolitan it is one of chara species charophytes 
found in north america and one of chara species in british columbia with c braunii recorded
there at three sites henry mann personal communication there are many morphotypes of plants in
the species of c braunii and mating experiments showed that not all populations of c braunii
were compatible and none were compatible with one c australis population although it is possible
that c braunii is the natural host of cv can we have not confirmed this 



viruses of 

the relative abundance of cv can sequences in rivers of british columbia varied over a month
period figure a and many non synonymous snvs were detected in the cv can population
 figure b similar variation was found in the new york metagenomic sequences ian hewson 
personal communication the dominance of non synonymous snvs suggests that the british
columbia rivers had more than one distinct cv can population high levels of non synonymous
mutations were reported in tobamoviruses when the viruses were passaged in a new host while
there is no way of investigating these possibilities with the present data the majority of snvs were
infrequent suggesting that they have not been fixed within the population and perhaps the cv can
population of british columbian rivers is over the long term a mega viral quasispecies 

the longest assembled sequence of the third possible record of a charavirus from new york state
 ts was nt and it had around nucleotide identity amino acid identity with
the homologous region from both cv can and cv aus thus there was no correlation between the
sequence differences of this region and the geographic distances between collection sites to
 km suggesting that the new york state sequence was from a distinct charavirus lineage not
from the cv can cv aus lineage 

the detection of cv can at some locations but not others likely reflects the distribution and
abundance of host populations chara spp are found in slow flowing frequently shallow lakes and
rivers or streams that are nutrient poor where they thrive in part due to the co occurrence
of nitrogen fixing epiphytic cyanobacteria the protected site where cv can was abundant
 figure a is a low nitrogen environment and is distinct from the agricultural sites where inorganic
nitrogen concentrations are higher the presence of cv can in the protected watershed suggests
that it could be used as an indicator species of low nitrogen and low turbidity freshwater environments
in british columbia similar studies could not be done at the original site where cv aus was
found as c australis plants are now rare as a result of drought siltation and fertilizer use over the past
four decades 

the phylogenies of the individual charavirus genes we report here are completely congruent with
the recently published phylogeny of the ‘global rna virome’ the charavirus rdrp helicase and
cp genes are related individually to genes of different viruses in ‘branch ’ of the wolf et al ’s phylogeny 
which includes the alphavirus and flavivirus supergroups the rdrp and cp genes belong
to different lineages of the alphaviruses and the helicases to those of flaviviruses however in all
instances the charavirus protein is a sister basal to those of viruses of extant related groups indicating
an ancestral relationship to them all rather than recent inter lineage recombination events 

a statistically significant correlation has been found between the phylogeny of most
tobamoviruses and their primary eudicotyledonous hosts confirming an earlier estimate of their
age based on protein evolution rates and indicating that tobamoviruses probably co evolved
with their hosts and are thus of a similar age which is now estimated to be around million
years this date can then be used to extrapolate from the two tobamovirus genes rdrps and
cps to other nodes in their respective gene phylogenies by comparing patristic distances that pass
through those nodes supplementary table s caution must of course be used in interpreting these
estimates figure as more than indicative given the analytical uncertainties generated by model
choice protein size etc the divergence of the two charaviruses was estimated to be mya rdrps 
and mya cps which places it in the same time period as the breakup of gondwana and the
final separation of australia from antarctica and hence the americas mya this divergence
correlates with the known distribution of c australis which is confined to lands that once formed
east gondwana whereas c braunii is cosmopolitan the earlier divergence dates of the rdrps
and cp genes – mya are also feasible given that the earliest unequivocal fossils gyrogonites
 oogonia of charophytes are from early devonian rocks mya an additional biochemical
clue of the likely deep relationship between charophytes and viruses is that charophytes but not
chlorophytes green algae or rhodophytes red algae have r genes encoding ‘nucleotide binding



viruses of 

site leucine rich repeat’ proteins which modulate the response of higher plants to pathogens such
as tmv enabling a ‘gene for gene’ modus vivendi 

figure summary of the estimates of gene divergence dates million years before present for the
charavirus tobamovirus and benyvirus rdrp and cp proteins the coloured triangles represent
monophyletic clusters i e two or more homologs of the proteins found in extant viruses and their
left hand tip represents the earliest likely age of each extant virus cluster 

branch lengths of the ‘global rna virome’ phylogeny suggest that the earliest embodiments
of the alphavirus flavivirus rdrp genes existed more than one billion years ago but the origins of the
tobamovirus charavirus cp gene are less certain the structure of the tmv monomer is known in great
detail it is a distinctive right handed anti parallel four helix bundle that is uncommon among
viruses of higher plants and animals and probably confined to virions of viruses of the virgaviridae 
all of which have straight tubular virions similar helical bundle proteins both left and right handed 
seem to occur only in the viruses of archaea and may be the source of the virgavirid charavirus
cp gene 

the ancestors of members of the contemporary genus chara are thought to be the closest
extant relatives of algae that gave rise to higher plants consequently charaviruses which have
clear evolutionary ties to tobamoviruses that infect higher plants provide a window into the shared
evolutionary history of these two groups of viruses these observations suggest that tobamoviruses
originated in aquatic environments and transitioned alongside their hosts to the terrestrial realm 
our results establish that charaviruses are a taxonomically distinct group with a distribution that
includes australia and north america moreover analysis of viral metagenomic data imply that
charaviruses occur as large genetically diverse populations that can be significant contributors to
rna virus metagenomic data in freshwater habitats these results imply that charaviruses are likely
important members of freshwater viral communities across the world
