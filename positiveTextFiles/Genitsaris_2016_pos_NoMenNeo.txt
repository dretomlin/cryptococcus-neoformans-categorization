abstract
the microbial taxonomic composition of the three domains of life in two coastal plankton
samples was assessed by random total community metagenomic sequencing and pcr based
rdna amplicon deep sequencing in order to compare the resulting diversity and investigate
possible limitations and complementarities of each method the various universal primer sets 
used to amplify different hypervariable rdna regions revealed the same major high level
taxonomic groups in bacteria and unicellular eukaryota and showed a scarce archaea
apparent richness however significant differences were found between the different primer
sets p value with the kolmogorov–smirnov test regarding both operational
taxonomic unit otu richness and relative abundance of the major high level taxonomic
groups detected based on the metagenomic approach the phylum bacteroidetes dominated
the prokaryotic community followed by proteobacteria while the detected eukaryotic
unicellular taxa belonged to the groups of alveolata fungi chlorophyta stramenopiles and
phaeophyceae these groups were found to carry genes typically found in microbial
communities which are linked to dna rna and protein metabolism and the synthesis of
nucleotides amino acids carbohydrates and vitamins although our findings suggest that the
total community metagenomic approach can provide a more comprehensive picture of the
planktonic microbial community structure a number of issues associated with this approach
emerged these issues include the still relatively high cost compared to amplicon sequencing 
the possible low coverage of the full marine diversity the insufficiency of databases for other
gene markers than the small subunit gene and the bias towards bacterial sequences because
of their higher abundance relative to eukaryotes in marine environments

the development of next generation sequencing ngs 
methodologies have revealed a surprising diversity of
planktonic organisms including a variety of new and 
or previously undetected groups belonging to bacteria 
archaea and eukaryota for a review see shokralla et al 
 in marine plankton studies amplicon deep 
sequencing is a very popular method of targeting inter

 and the structure of the rare archaeal biosphere
 hugoni et al pcr associated biases in this
approach include limited primer universality hadziav 
dic et al pcr amplification errors nucleotide

were somehow thrown aside when deep sequencing
appeared further biases of deep sequencing which
involve pyrosequencing errors kunin et al 
copy number variations among taxa medinger et al 
 and limitation when performing meta analysis
of different samples sequenced with different primers

in the continuing growth of sequencing technology 
methods aiming to circumvent these issues have been
further developed one of these the total community
metagenomic sequencing is an approach that pro 
duces high throughput random genomic sequences 
without a pcr step this approach has largely benefited
from the emergence of ngs technologies as the
sequencing of a continuously larger number of
sequences is feasible this method could provide a rela 
tively unbiased way to assess microbial composition 
and allow the identification of the gene pool content
across various functional categories venter et al 
delong et al it has mainly been used to either
assemble bacterial genomes e g margulies et al 
farrer et al or to explore microbial communities
in patients for medical purposes lupski et al 
and in some cases has led to several major discoveries
of new higher level taxa e g di rienzi et al a
recent investigation into the microbial community of
two marine systems showed that the difference in
anthropogenic pressures on these systems could be
assessed using this method through combining infor 
mation on the detected taxonomic groups and meta 
bolic pathways kisand et al 

the main objectives of the present study were to
assess the potential the limitations and the comple 
mentarities of the total community metagenomic
approach in comparison to the more frequently used
rdna amplicon deep sequencing to achieve these
three objectives both approaches were used indepen 
dently of each other to investigate the microbial taxo 
nomic diversity and composition of the three domains
of life bacteria archaea and eukaryota in two repli 
cates from a meso eutrophic coastal system the
eastern english channel in addition the gene pool
content was explored using the metagenomic
approach in this system the planktonic microbial com 
munity has been well documented over the last decade
in terms of microscopical lamy et al gratte 
panche et al a b and molecular using
rdna amplicon deep sequencing observations
 monchy et al christaki et al the choice
to analyse replicates from a single date during the
early spring bloom period was considered the best
compromise between the high cost of the
implemented methodologies the necessity for replica 
tion e g prosser knight et al and the inten 
tion to target two different hypervariable small subunit
 ssu rrna gene regions for each of the domains of life 
the methodology selected to perform the analysis of
the samples was based on commonly used tools in
marine environmental studies see bik et al 
the present study was to serve as a test case for the

combined methods of rdna amplicon deep sequen 
cing and total community metagenomic analyses 

materials and methods

sample collection

the sampling site representative of the coastal water
masses of the eastern english channel was located at
the somlit french network of coastal observatories 
station ° ′ ′′n ° ′ ′′e – m water depth 
the physical chemical hydrological and biological
properties encountered at this site are sampled and
measured monthly sampling for this study was
carried out on march during the early spring
bloom period table si supplementary material at
high tide at a depth of m this transition period
was chosen to investigate the taxonomic composition
and the gene pool content of the microbial community
as it contains a rich prokaryotic lamy et al and
eukaryotic diversity christaki et al 

two separate l seawater samples were collected
in sterile polyethylene bottles and kept at an in situ
temperature in the dark until filtration less than h
later each water sample replicate was screened with
a μm mesh to retain larger metazoa and the
flow through was filtered on μm nucleopore filters
 mm diameter using a very low filtration pressure
peristaltic pump rpm in order to avoid filter clog 
ging and to minimize cell disruption larger membrane
filters can improve dna yield and reduce variation in
dna recovery the filters were sliced into small pieces
using a sterile scalpel and stored in nalgenetm

general long term storage cryogenic tubes ml at
− °c until analysis 

the planktonic organisms’ dna was extracted and
purified with the powerwater® dna isolation kit

volume of extract following the manufacturer’s proto 
col the two replicates r and r contained and
 ng μl− of dna respectively as measured by the
qubit® fluorometer thermo fischer scientific inc 
ma usa this dna yield although higher than dna
concentrations in previous samples from the same
study site see genitsaris et al is relatively low
compared to other meso eutrophic coastal areas this
could be explained by the removal of metazoans
during the pre filtration step prior to dna extraction 

total community metagenomic sequencing

the taxonomic composition and the gene pool content
of the entire microbial community was examined using

a metagenomic approach based on random total com 
munity sequencing of the replicated water samples
from the somlit site for this we used the gs
flx sequencer roche applied sciences with the
long read chemistry of roche applied sciences sup 
plied by the gs flx system which provides read

processing and annotation

first the raw reads were quality pre treated using the
prinseq lite perl script schmieder edwards 
with the following screen low quality ends having a
phred quality score below were removed reads
with lengths below bp and over bp were
excluded a maximum of of ambiguous bases n 
was accepted the ‘shotgun’ key of bp in the ′ end
of the sequences was also removed and filters on
the mean quality of the sequences threshold set to
 were applied subsequently the pre and non 
treated sequences were assembled with gs de novo
assembler version roche applied sciences using
 bases overlap and overlap identity implement 
ing the ‘ rip’ option this option appends one sequence
into one unique contig the raw reads as well as both
the pre and non treated contigs were processed and
annotated using the mg rast server meyer et al 
 the metagenome data are available through

pcr and rdna amplicon deep sequencing

total genomic dna from both replicates was amplified
by pcr using two sets of universal primers for each

downstream sequence processing was performed
using the mothur software following the stan

 primer sequences and key fragments were
removed and only reads above bp long with
homopolymers shorter than bp were kept each
data set was de replicated to the unique reads and
aligned against the silva database chimera
detection of the unique reads was performed with
the uchime software edgar and potential chi 
meras were subsequently removed the remaining

 s genitsaris et al 



reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units
 otus at a similarity threshold 

data sets from the two replicates were normalized
per primer set using mothur over of the
sequences were single singletons unique amplicons
occurring only once although it has been suggested
that these are probably sequencing artefacts and
should be removed from the data set huse et al 
 kunin et al a large amount of the valid
sequences can be lost thus the single singletons
that had ‘close reference’ similarity on 
of their length with sequences submitted in the
silva database were retained in the ‘optimized’
data set about of the single singletons for each
sample were considered as valid sequences the rest
of the single singletons were discarded concerning
the sequences produced by the eukaryotic primers 
sequences assigned to metazoa were removed 

data analysis

rarefaction curves and the richness estimator schao for
all rdnaamplicon sequenced samples and themeta 
genomes were calculated with the past c software
 hammer et al for themetagenomes rarefaction
curves and diversity indexes were calculated based on
abundance measurements at the genus level taxo 
nomic affiliation was performed on the most abundant
otus produced by rdna amplicon deep sequencing
 table siii supplementary information comprising
 of all eukaryotic sequences and of all bac 
terial sequences in the corresponding samples the
threshold was determined in order to include of
the total number of sequences in each of the corre 
sponding samples see fuhrman these otus
were compared with blastn queries against the nr nt
nucleotide database of the ncbi for the detection of
the closest cultured or uncultured relatives table siii 
concerning eukaryotes their taxonomic affiliation was
also verified by blastn against the pr database
 guillou et al finally the two replicateswere com 
pared at the otu level for the rdna amplicon data sets
and at the genus level for the metagenomic data sets
with the kolmogorov–smirnov test in the r software 
the kolmogorov–smirnov test was also used to
compare the results produced by the different primer
sets per domain of life

total community metagenomic sequencing

random metagenomic sequencing was performed in
the total community dna extracted from two biological
replicates on a single sampling date overall about
 × single reads mean read length between 
and bps were generated from the two replicates 
these reads produced around × contigs in total 
with a mean sequence length between and
 bps after quality control of the reads or
contigs were removed from each replicate table siii 
within this data set more than of the sequences
were annotated into proteins table siv supplementary
material a good estimation for taxonomic affiliation
and gene annotation was observed among all m nr
databases with of hits occurring below the e 
value threshold of e− figure s no significant differ 
ences on contig abundance and taxonomic distribution
were observed between the two replicates based on the
kolmogorov–smirnov test p all metagenomic
profiles raw data and contigs non and pre treated
data sets showed similar taxonomic distribution
 figure s supplementary information therefore in
the following sections the pre treated contigs data
were used to present the taxonomic composition and
gene pool content of the microbial community this
data set displayed a larger sequence length table siv 
providing more confident annotations 

taxonomical composition based on total
community metagenomic sequencing

in both replicates more than of the sequences tax 
onomically annotated were affiliated to bacteria while
 and were affiliated to eukaryotic taxa for r 
and r respectively moreover about of the
eukaryotic taxa belonged to unicellular organisms
 figure concerning the bacterial taxonomic groups 
flavobacteria belonging to bacteroidetes dominated
the class distribution comprising and of
the total number of sequences for r and r respect 
ively they were followed by α proteobacteria 
and and γ proteobacteria and 
eukaryotic unicellular taxa were comprised of groups
of bacillariophyceae ascomycota chlorophyta basidio 
mycota apicomplexa found only in r figure and
phaeophyceae found only in r figure each of
these groups contributed between and to

the total number of eukaryotic sequences a small frac 
tion of the sequences were annotated to viruses and in
particular bacteriophages representing about of
the total virus sequences in each replicate while only
few archaeal sequences were detected of the
total number of sequences in each replicate figure 

considering a lower taxonomic level the most abun 
dant sequences affiliated at the genus level of
the total number of sequences belongedmainly to bac 
teria and were dominated by the bacteroidetes and
proteobacteria groups figure s supplementary
material the most abundant taxon was the bacteroi 
detes polaribacter with and annotated
sequences for r and r respectively followed by the
α proteobacteria roseobacter and and rue 
geria and among the most abundant taxa 
the genus nematostella belonging to cnidaria was
the only representative of eukaryotic sequences com 
prising and sequences for r and r respectively 
while t like viruses and the bacteria cellulophaga bur 
kholderia loktanella shewanella robiginitalea sacchar 
ophagus and jannoschia appeared among the most
abundant taxa in r figure s 

gene pool content based on total community
metagenomic sequencing

predicted functional annotation of the assembled
sequences using the subsystems database signified the
occurrence of common functional groups in both repli 
cates in particular genes associated with clustering 
based subsystems cbs linked among others with fatty
acidmetabolism cell division and cytochromebiogenesis 
were found in addition some genes were linked with
dna rna and protein metabolism and genes related to
nucleotides amino acids carbohydrates and vitamin
synthesis were predominantly present in both replicates 
comprising of the total annotated sequences 
other functions related to cell wall and capsule biosyn 
thesis membrane transportation respiration virulence 
stress response cell signalling and division compound
metabolism dormancy and photosynthesis were also
detected figure s supplementary material the
majority of the characteristic metabolic pathways and
protein connections in a microbial community as inter 
preted by the kegg mapper were represented in both
replicates data not shown 

according to the best hit classification of the func 
tional groups functional groups were distributed
among eight assigned high level taxonomic groups
of unicellular organisms figure in particular the
most abundant groups of bacteria were associated
with compound synthesis nucleotides amino acids 

 s genitsaris et al 



carbohydrates vitamins and prosthetic groups dna 
rna protein and various compounds metabolism
and membrane transportation the eukaryotic groups
were mainly linked with genes associated with respir 
ation processes which is not surprising due to the
high copy nature of the mitochondrial genome and
rna and protein metabolism the viruses detected
had the putative ability to express dna metabolism
genes and genes associated with phages plasmids
and transposable elements figure 

microbial composition based on rdna amplicon

metagenomic sequencing

ribosomal dna amplicon deep sequencing was used
to explore the diversity and composition of all three
domains of life in the two replicates by targeting

different hyper variable regions of the ssu rrna
gene table i ribosomal dna amplicon sequencing
produced only five archaea related otus with the
two different primer sets used table siii this is con 
sistent with the very low presence of archaeal
sequences detected in the metagenomic profiles
 of the total number of sequences figure 
due to this low archaeal diversity in the study area 
archaea were not considered further compar

bacterial and eukaryotic primers p values between
 and for all primer sets 

the overall bacteria and eukaryota distribution of
otus within the major high level taxonomic groups
was statistically different among primer sets p value
 in particular concerning bacterial sequences 
both primer sets gave a similar taxonomic represen 
tation of the major high level taxonomic groups 
except for bacteroidetes which had almost double
the number of otus with the s d bact primers
 figure concerning eukaryotic sequences alveolata 
including dinophyceae and ciliophora was the predo 
minant group for both primer sets while stramenopiles
had almost twice the number of otus with the tareuk
primers figure however the s f primers
amplified additional high level groups including api 
complexa cryptophyta and haptophyta not shown 
that were not detected with the tareuk primers 

in the metagenomes the bacterial community was
dominated by bacteroidetes related taxa almost

fewer sequences were attributed to proteobacteria 
related taxa in comparison with the rdna amplicon
sequencing concerning the eukaryotic metagenome 
the bacillariophyceae related taxa were almost four
times more abundant in comparison with the pcr 
amplified data sets while the alveolata related taxa
were considerably fewer figure to highlight this 
microscopical observation limited to the free living
plankton organisms with size μm revealed that
the dominant group of eukaryotic unicellular organ 
isms was bacillariophyta comprising of the

taxonomic composition based on rdna
amplicon deep sequencing

based on the rdna amplicon data sets the same major
high level taxonomic groups were detected in bacteria

 bacteroidetes and proteobacteria and unicellular
eukaryota alveolata and stramenopiles with the
different primer sets yet they produced different out 
comes when focused on the lower level taxa e g at
the genus level the accuracy of blast derived taxon 
omy especially for low level taxa depends on the
sequence length the database coverage for the
specific taxonomic group and the correct identification
of the reference sequence bik et al in addition 
statistically significant p value differences of
the relative taxonomic composition and species richness
were detected among the primer sets furthermore 
among the eukaryotic sequences the s f primers
amplified sequences from high level groups that were
not detected with the tareuk primers such as apicom 
plexa cryptophyta and haptophyta the choice of
primers affects the biodiversity assessment of an ecosys 
tem hong et al as full primer universality is diffi 
cult or impossible to achieve hadziavdic et al 
limitations of the primers’ universality produce con 
straints as it excludes taxonomic groups in the analysis 
and introduces biases in favour of some taxa polz 
cavanaugh lanzen et al 

in order to investigate this comprehensively the
microbial diversity and composition of two different
hyper variable ssu rrna gene regions for each domain
of life were targeted the regions v –v and v –v for
bacteria and v –v and v for eukaryota were chosen 
several studies have applied the v region in assess 
ments of the microbial composition for both bacteria
and eukaryota in various ecosystems e g youssef et al 
 stoeck et al klindworth et al 
because it has been suggested that it is a prominent can 
didate to reveal a realistic picture of microbial diversity
for both domains pernice et al however different
research groups have used different primer sets to assess
microbial diversity perplexing direct comparisons
between samples hadziavdic et al 

regarding single singletons many researchers tend
to discard them as possible errors choosing a conser 
vative but more reliable estimation of diversity e g 
huse et al kunin et al however there is
a risk of removing valid sequences in this study the
low number of samples sequenced produced a large
number of singleton reads some of which could be
valid sequences that could be determined if numerous
samples were processed together in order to retain as
much diversity as possible and be confident that no
sequencing errors are contained in the data set 
‘close reference’ reads were included based on the
concept that ‘all observed sequences must be similar
to previously known sequences’ bik et al the
‘close reference’ single singletons comprised about

marine biology research 



 of the total number of single singletons among
uncultured taxa and taxa belonging to dominant
high level taxonomic groups a few singleton phylo 
types belonging to under represented high level taxo 
nomic groups such as phaeocystaceae for eukaryota
and cyanobacteria for bacteria were included 

taxonomic composition and gene pool content
based on total community metagenomic
sequencing

based on the total community metagenomic sequen 
cing data the bacterial groups of bacteroidetes α 
and γ proteobacteria dominated the microbial commu 
nity a previous study in the area highlighted the dom 
inance of the same high level prokaryotic taxonomic
groups during the early spring bloom lamy et al 
 it was suggested that they were major partici 
pants in leucine incorporation of the active bacterial
community in our samples these groups included
genes encoding several functions usually found in
microbial communities which included protein rna
and dna metabolism biosynthesis and degradation
of carbohydrates and lipids compound metabolism 
cell division cycle and signalling stress response and
virulence figure s in particular bacteroidetes have
genes linked with polymer degradation including a
large number of peptidases hydrolases and glycosyl
transferases fernández gómez et al also
found with total community metagenomic analysis in
our samples in addition α proteobacteria are associ 
ated among others with the metabolism of a number
of organic compounds sulphur oxidation and the pro 
duction of secondary metabolites brinkhoff et al 
 while γ proteobacteria comprise several patho 
gens that include virulence and disease genes
 persson et al in our data set around of
the genes were associated with virulence and
disease analysis of the global ocean sampling meta 
genomic data rusch et al has indicated that
virulence related genes are present in up to of
the planktonic bacteria with the highest values
detected in eutrophic waters persson et al 

the samples’ dominant microorganism belonged to
the genus polaribacter a marine bacteroidetes with a
dual life strategy as with many known marine bacter 
oidetes riemann et al polaribacter benefits from
colonization on particle surfaces and polymer degra 
dation in addition the presence of the proteorhodop 
sin gene provides a survival advantage in nutrient 
depleted sunlit surface waters gonzález et al 
kirchman and could be an explanation for polar 
ibacter’s dominance in the microbial community 

according to the total community metagenomic
approach eukaryotic sequences comprised only 
of the total number of sequences as expected this
relatively low abundance is in accordance with the
metagenomic analysis of marine microbial commu 
nities by kisand et al and it can be attributed
to the relatively high different abundances of prokar 
yota and eukaryota in marine samples of the same
volume furthermore this low number of sequences
could cause the discrepancies among the low level
eukaryotic taxa identified in the two replicates as the
coverage of the eukaryotic community was limited 
these discrepancies could also be attributed to
factors related to sequence sampling such as uneven
sampling of low abundance taxa but they could also
be due to differences occurring at the stage of dna
extraction e g cells are not always equally well dis 
rupted library preparation and sequencing all these
steps can randomly or systematically introduce devi 
ations between replicates the eukaryotic community
was dominated by alveolata related sequences fol 
lowed by stramenopiles and fungi this composition
resembles marine protist community compositions
reported in previous studies using microscopy and
molecular techniques e g countway et al grat 
tepanche et al a b christaki et al 

a low number of archaeal sequences were detected 
in accordance with the rdna amplicon analysis and a
previous study in the area using micro fish analysis
 lamy et al in addition a low number of
sequences affiliated with viruses and mainly phages
 of the viral sequences were detected this was
not surprising as most environmental free virus like
particles vlps in the water column are phages breit 
bart rohwer a noticeable functional category
that was associated with phages was phosphorus
metabolism figure this is consistent with many
marine phages which encode enzymes involved in
phosphate metabolism e g chen lu 

potential and limitations of total community
metagenomic sequencing in relation to rdna
amplicon deep sequencing

both methods detected the same major high level
taxonomic groups in bacteria and unicellular eukaryota
and corroborated the low presence of archaeal phylo 
types however the results did not concur when
focused on the lower level taxa e g at the genus level 

the two approaches also showed different relative
taxonomic composition among the high level taxa 
with amplicon sequencing alveolata were over rep 
resented and at the same time bacillariophyceae 

 s genitsaris et al 



related taxa were under represented as shown by
microscopy identification on the contrary total com 
munity metagenomic sequencing does not include
an initial pcr step except during the sequencing
library clonal amplification and the related possible
biases such as the primer universality and presented
a similar picture with microscopy regarding the taxo 
nomic diversity and abundance of these groups the
under representation of bacillariophyceae with rdna
amplicon sequencing may suggest that they are
‘masked’ by the high number of ssu rrna gene
copies of other groups such as the alveolata prokopo 
wich et al zhu et al and can also be associ 
ated with the low bacillariophyceae affiliation of the
universal primers used 

on the other hand these differences in estimation
of taxonomic diversity could also be attributed to pro 
blems associated with the metagenomic approach 
with the metagenomic sequencing more than 
of the sequences did not get annotated a part of
those could be non coding regions but also the anno 
tation heavily depends on the coverage of sequence
data for a taxon or a gene function in the query data 
base thus biases or low sequence coverage in the
reference databases might reflect biases in taxonomic
representation observed between the two approaches
at lower levels 

total community metagenomic sequencing could
circumvent the non universality of the existing
primers making microbial community meta analysis
feasible furthermore by including other gene
markers in the analysis additional to the ssu rrna
gene it can be used more assuredly to assess the diver 
sity and composition of an environmental sample than
conventional pcr based rrna studies venter et al 
 still databases for other genes are not extensive
enough one exception when investigating protistan
diversity might be to use the mitochondrial cyto 
chrome oxidase i gene coi which is routinely used
in different studies e g nassanova et al lara
et al finally total community metagenomic
sequencing also offers identification of the gene pool
content and as a consequence a more comprehensive
picture of the structure of microbial communities
 venter et al however a number of associated
limitations need to be addressed i first the cost of
total community metagenomic sequencing can be 
times higher than rdna amplicon sequencing redu 
cing the number of samples that can be analysed ii 
an environmental sample can typically contain thou 
sands of genomes consisting of thousands of genes 
obtaining around million raw sequences per plate
run with the existing technology or even millions

with illumina may still not be sufficient to unveil all
members of a community iii the coverage of
marine communities’ eukaryotic diversity can be
further challenging as in marine samples the majority
of sequences are associated with bacteria see results 
also kisand et al a possible solution for this
could be the differential filtration of the water sample
according to size differential filtration of the sample
according to size may increase the recovery of protists 
over bacteria and serve the purpose of covering a
higher eukaryote marine diversity when using a meta 
genomic approach however differential filtration may
also lead to other biases such as inconsistency
between replicates fenchel finlay hypoth 
esized that smaller protists are more likely to have a
wider and more homogeneous dispersal consistent
with this it was shown that smaller fraction – 
µm replicates were more similar to each other in
terms of composition compared to replicates from
the larger size fraction µm duret et al 
also size fractionation might result in finding larger
taxa in smaller fractions due to the breaking of
bodily parts so such practices should be cautiously
assessed iv in highly complex metagenomes such
as those produced by total community metagenomic
sequencing the probability of observing matching
sequences originating from the exact same locus is
very low gomez alvarez et al so in this
study’s case the term otu is not applicable there 
fore the assignment of reads or contigs to species 
and the direct comparison of loci remains a chal 
lenge new methodologies such as concoct alne 
berg et al have been developed to improve
reads assembly thus allowing better reads assign 
ment quantification of their abundance and revealing
strain level variation 

overall as the cost of sequencing decreases and
data processing pipelines optimize total community
metagenomic sequencing has been shown to be a
promising method in integrating sequencing data
into ecological processes and offering insights into
the complex interaction between genes organisms 
communities and environmental features thus this
method could be ideal to explore unfamiliar and
extreme systems and along with in depth targeted
sequencing to address questions about microbial
structure and functioning
