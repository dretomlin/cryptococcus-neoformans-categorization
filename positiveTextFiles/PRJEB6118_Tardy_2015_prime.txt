land use practices alter the biomass and structure of soil microbial communities however the impact of
land management intensity on soil microbial diversity i e richness and evenness and consequences for
functioning is still poorly understood here we addressed this question by coupling molecular charac 
terization of microbial diversity with measurements of carbon c mineralization in soils obtained from
three locations across europe each representing a gradient of land management intensity under
different soil and environmental conditions bacterial and fungal diversity were characterized by high
throughput sequencing of ribosomal genes carbon cycling activities i e mineralization of autochtho 
nous soil organic matter mineralization of allochthonous plant residues were measured by quantifying
 c and c co release after soils had been amended or not with

 c labelled wheat residues vari 
ation partitioning analysis was used to rank biological and physicochemical soil parameters according to
their relative contribution to these activities across all three locations microbial diversity was greatest
at intermediate levels of land use intensity indicating that optimal management of soil microbial di 
versity might not be achieved under the least intensive agriculture microbial richness was the best
predictor of the c cycling activities with bacterial and fungal richness explaining and of the
intensity of autochthonous soil organic matter mineralization and fungal richness explaining of the
intensity of wheat residues mineralization altogether our results provide evidence that there is scope
for improvement in soil management to enhance microbial biodiversity and optimize c transformations

 introduction

in recent decades human societies have adopted policies for
land use intensification based on the conversion of complex natural
gy rue sully dijon 

p a maron 
ecosystems into simplified managed ecosystems intensification of
resource use through the mechanization of agricultural practices 
and increased use of inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides
 tscharntke et al dallimer et al this was originally
motivated by the need to improve production to meet growing
demands for food however it also led to profound alterations of
the soil physicochemical properties as well as of above ground and
below ground biodiversity giller et al thiele bruhn et al

v tardy et al soil biology biochemistry e 
 bagella et al for a long time the development of
intensive agriculture was not impeded by impairment of biodi 
versity since the replacement of self regulatory functions driven by
soil organisms and their links with plants was considered by many
to be offset by chemical and mechanical inputs this viewpoint 
however is being challenged by an increasing awareness that the
sustainability of agricultural systems in terms of their capacity to
maintain functions and ecosystem services is compromised by the
disruption of physicochemical and biological soil properties
 thiele bruhn et al de vries et al this has evidenced
the need to define new modes of land use management which are
adapted to the preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity to
promote the driving of functions by biodiversity and reduce the use
of chemical and mechanical inputs to attain this objective how 
ever our ability to predict the effects of agricultural practices on soil
biodiversity and functioning needs to be improved 

microbial diversity with its hundreds to thousands of taxa per
gram of soil dominates soil biodiversity torsvik and Øvreås 
and contributes to key soil functions involved in themaintenance of
soil fertility and environmental and water quality the impacts of
increasing land use intensity on soil food webs have been docu 
mented giller et al bardgett and cook thiele bruhn
et al de vries et al as have effects on the biomass 
activity and structure of microbial and faunal communities meyer
et al tsiafouli et al however effects of land use in 
tensity on the diversity of soil microbial communities remain
largely unknown this question needs to be addressed not only
because of the intrinsic value of microbial diversity in terms of a
natural patrimony that needs to be preserved but also because
variations in the “amount” of soil diversity are likely to have sig 
nificant repercussions in terms of soil nutrient cycling baumann
et al philippot et al pathogen management vivant
et al and stability of ecosystem services to environmental
changes tardy et al recent studies based on estimates of
the metrics of microbial diversity in terms of richness number of
species and evenness equality or distribution of individuals in
samples obtained over gradients of land use intensity suggest that
microbial diversity may not follow a linear negative relationship to
land management intensity but instead a hump backed relation 
ship �alvarez molina et al lai et al with lower values
at low and high intensity and higher values at moderate intensity
 acosta martínez et al jangid et al shange et al 
 however each of these studies focused only on the bacte 
rial community in a single soil type which limits the applicability of
the conclusions in addition they did not couple biodiversity mea 
surements with estimates of soil functioning and the functional
significance of microbial diversity changes in response to land use
remains an open question thus new studies are needed to
improve our knowledge of the patterns of microbial diversity and
activity response to land management intensity 

the aim of this study was to investigate the impact on microbial
 bacteria and fungi diversity of changes in land management in 
tensity in different farming systems and to test how this links to
transformations of soil organicmatter seddaiu et al amajor
function driven mostly by fungal and bacterial communities in soil
 de boer et al for this we sampled soils from three loca 
tions in different parts of europe each offering a gradient of land
use intensity and covering a range of environmental conditions 
the impact of land use on microbial diversity was assessed with a
meta barcoded pyrosequencing technique targeting ribosomal
genes terrat et al by generating several thousand se 
quences this approach provides an accurate estimate of soil mi 
crobial diversity including assessment of the richness and
evenness of microbial communities changes in soil respiration
patterns were measured by monitoring c and c co release
after the soils had been amended or not with c labelled wheat
residues to study the response of microbial activity to the incor 
poration of an allochtonous carbon source in soil baumann et al 
 lienhard et al the resulting data obtained for mi 
crobial diversity c mineralisation and soil chemical and physical
properties were analysed using variation partitioning to rank their
relative contributions to c mineralization in soil 

 materials and methods

 experimental sites soil sampling and analysis

our study involved sampling soils from three locations across
europe under mediterranean to temperate bioclimatic conditions 
each with gradients of soil management intensity low medium
and high it is important to precise here that since the parameters
determining the land use intensity level differed greatly between
the three locations intensity levels were not comparable among
the locations however as presented below a gradient truly existed
at each site consequently in this study the sampling strategy
including these three contrasted locations was designed to identify
general trends in terms of community response to land use in 
tensity and not to compare among the locations 

the veluwe chronosequence is located on a � km area
with post glacial loamy sand in central netherlands and is
composed of abandoned ex agricultural fields which have been
abandoned and reverted into semi natural grasslands kardol et al 
 van der wal et al holtkamp et al the gradient
of management intensity is based on three individual long term
abandoned fields abandoned for e years ve low three
distinct medium term abandoned fields e years ve med and
three distinct short term abandoned fields e years ve high the
vegetation at this site consisted of seminatural grass forb vegeta 
tion with festuca rubra agrostis capillaris jacobaea vulgaris and
plantago lanceolata as dominant grasses and forbs kardol et al 
 interestingly compared to the other two locations this
gradient integrates a strong temporal aspect with the intensity
being determined more by the time since abandonment referring
to a high management intensity at the moment of the abandon 
ment rather than by the actual management intensity all aban 
doned fields are subject to extensive natural grazing bywild horses 
deer wild boar and small mammals in order to prevent forest
development 

the berchidda site is located in the northern hills of sardinia 
italy and characterized by an agro forest ecosystem under same
soil and similar topography bagella et al the low intensity
treatment be low is a semi natural grassland not manured nor
tilled since at least years emerging from the selective mechan 
ical cutting of the understory of a cork oak forest to get access for
the cork harvest the medium intensity treatment be med is a
wooded grassland e tree cover of cork oaks grazed by
sheep and periodically cultivated e years to grow annual
forage crops rossetti et al the high intensity treatment be 
high consists of intensively managed permanent grassland grazed
and periodically cultivated e years to grow annual forage crops
 bagella et al the vegetation at this site was represented by
cork oak woods of the violo dehnhardtii quercetum suberis asso 
ciation therophytes were much more abundant than pe 
rennials mainly represented by hemicriptophytes unpalatable
species were the most numerous whilst the only excellent forage
species were lolium rigidum trifolium subterraneum t incarnatum
and t michelianum bagella et al 

in england a series of mesotrophic grasslands in the yorkshire

 soil microcosms

microcosms were set up by placing g of equivalent dry soil in
 ml hermetically sealed plasma flasks these soil microcosms
were supplemented with sterile water to attain soil water 
holding capacity after weeks pre incubation at �c the mi 
crocosms were then either amended with c residues of wheat

bead beater to obtain a powder c n ratio of wheat residues ¼ 
and c labelling ¼ or were not amended control wheat
residues were used as “model” c input to assess the response of
microbial activity to addition of a given quality of plant material in
all soils although they were not amended with wheat control

 dna extraction and molecular microbial biomass

from g of soil from each triplicate microcosm of each intensity
level from each location using the iso procedure petric
et al which had been slightly modified plassart et al 
 to include a mechanical lysis step using fastprep® 
instead of the recommended mini bead beater cell disruptor dna
concentrations of crude extracts were determined by electropho 
resis in a agarose gel using a calf thymus dna standard curve 
and used as estimates of microbial molecular biomass dequiedt

lute gel extraction kit qiagen courtaboeuf france 
 pyrosequencing of s and s rrna gene sequences

bacterial and fungal diversities were determined at t for the
three levels of land use intensity for each location triplicates level
of location by pyrosequencing of ribosomal genes for bacte 
ria a s rrna gene fragment with sequence variability and the
appropriate size about bases for pyrosequencing was
amplified by pcr using the primers f and r for fungi an s
rrna gene fragment of about bases was amplified using the
primers fr and ff primers and pcr conditions were as
described previously tardy et al the pcr products were
purified using a minelute gel extraction kit qiagen courtaboeuf 
france and quantified using the picogreen staining kit molecular
probes paris france a second pcr of cycles was then conducted
under similar pcr conditions with purified pcr products and ten
base pair multiplex identifiers added to the primers at position to
specifically identify each sample and avoid pcr biases finally the
pcr products were purified and quantified as previously described 
pyrosequencing was then carried out on a gs flx titanium roche
 sequencing system 

 bioinformatics analysis of s and s rrna gene sequences

bioinformatic analyses were done using the gns pipe devel 
oped by the genosol platform inra dijon france and initially
described by terrat et al first all reads were sorted ac 
cording to the chosen identifiers sequences the raw reads were
then filtered and deleted based on their a length b number of
ambiguities ns and c primer s sequence s we then applied
perl programs to obtain strict dereplication alignment of reads
using infernal alignments cole et al and clustered at 
sequence similarity into operational taxonomic units otu that
cluster rare reads with abundant ones and do not count differences
in homopolymer lengths another homemade filtering step was
then applied to eliminate potential sources of errors e g pcr
chimeras sequencing errors otu overestimation in order to
efficiently compare the datasets and avoid biased community
comparisons the samples reads were reduced by random selection
closed to the lowest datasets and reads for s and
 s rrna gene sequences respectively the retained high quality
reads were used for i taxonomy independent analyses to
determine simpson shannon and richness diversity indices us 
ing the defined otu composition and ii taxonomy based analysis
using similarity approaches against dedicated reference databases
from silva the simpson indexmeasures the probability that two
individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to the
same species i e same otu in our study for this diversity index 
the higher the value is the greater the diversity simpson s index
gives more weight to the more abundant species in a sample the
addition of rare species to a sample causes only small changes in
the value of d contrary to the shannon index the raw data sets are
available on the ebi database system under project accession

 total and c co measurements

respired co total and c co was measured after 
 days of incubation on triplicates of the
amended and control microcosms at each sampling date the
gaseous phase headspace in microcosms was sampled in ml
airtight flasks to measure the co concentration and in ml
airtight flasks to determine the carbon isotope abundances since
the microcosms were hermetically sealed and aerated by flushing
with air at each sampling date the measured concentrations cor 
responded to the co accumulated in the microcosm headspace

whereas bacterial diversity estimated using the simpson index 
was greatest in be med this response was not related to a greater
bacterial richness but a higher evenness of the bacterial commu 
nity data not shown 

nmds analysis of the full bacterial and fungal sequences
datasets enabled the structures of the bacterial and fungal com 
munities to be discriminated according to location and manage 
ment intensity fig the main parameter discriminating both
bacterial and fungal communities was the “location effect” with
distinct structures observed between the three locations confirmed
by anosim test r ¼ p ¼ for bacteria and r ¼ 
p ¼ for fungi the same dominant bacterial and fungal phyla
were detected in all three locations but the distribution of these
groups in terms of relative abundance varied according to the
location actinobacteria firmicutes and basidiomycota were more
frequent at the berchidda location proteobacteria ascomycota and
glomeromycota were more abundant at the veluwe location and
bacteroidetes planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae 
glomeromycota and chytridiomycota were more abundant in the
yorkshire dales fig 

land use intensity also significantly impacted the structure of
bacterial and fungal communities at each site r ¼ p ¼

than by biotic variables all variables were always positively
correlated with the measured activities except fungal richness that
was negatively correlated with basal respiration 

the identity and or rank of the most predictive variables varied
according to the activity more precisely bacterial richness was the
best predictor of basal and total c mineralization however fungal
richness explained of basal respiration negatively corre 
lated but was not a significant driver of total c mineralization 
among the abiotic variables fine sand and soil organic c content
were both good predictors of basal and total c mineralization in
contrast to the two above mentioned activities bacterial diversity
was not a significant driver of wheat residue mineralization and pe 
which were instead driven by fungal diversity thus fungal rich 
ness accounted very strongly for wheat residue mineraliza 
tion and fungal diversity explained a small but significant part of
the variance in pe soil c n ratio an indicator of organic
matter quality but not soil organic c content was also a predictor of
wheat residue mineralization and pe a very significant proportion
of the variance in pe was explained by fine sand soil content 

negative correlations were observed for soc and wheat resi 
dues mineralization as well as for fungal simpson soil c n and
pe however these negative correlations were weakly significant
 p indicating that in our study these parameters were not
strong predictors of the activities measured in the case of rr our
results suggested that the quality of soil organic matter c n 
p rather than the quantity soc p may be deter 
minant for wheat residues decomposition for priming effect result
suggested that pe may be increased for lower values of c n ¼ less
recalcitrant organic matter which makes sense since energy
needed to re activate organic matter decomposition may be lower
for low values of c n 
 discussion

microbial diversity and composition differed more between the
three contrasting locations across europe than between the three
treatments within each location microbial diversity was not ex 
pected to be similar at all locations but results showed that the
“site effect” was more important than the “land use effect” in
modifying the diversity of the communities the large differences
in soil physicochemical characteristics plant cover and climate
between the three locations is likely to have largely accounted for
the discrimination of microbial communities in terms of richness
and composition fierer and jackson dequiedt et al 
de vries et al b kuramae et al table microbial
composition provided indications about the environmental filters
that may have driven the microbial diversity in each location for
instance the greater abundance of actinobacteria and firmicutes at
berchidda suggests that the microbial diversity signature may have
been influenced by the mediterranean climate at this location 
indeed both groups share the ability to produce endospores which
has been shown to increase their ability to survive stressful climatic
conditions such as warming and desiccation over other phyla
 hayden et al sharmin et al in addition plant cover 
and especially the presence of oaks might also explain the greater
overall contribution of basidiomycota to the fungal composition at
this location in agreement with orgiazzi et al this fungal
group is indeed widely represented in forest soils since it possesses
improved metabolic capacities for decomposing lignocellulose a
major component of organic c in tree wood debris de boer et al 
 baldrian vo�rí�skov�a and baldrian the veluwe
and yorkshire dales sites were dominated by proteobacteria and
bacteroidetes two groups described as fast growing copiotrophs
stimulated by c rich environments fierer et al pascault
et al which is in agreement with the higher overall c con 
tent measured at these two sites than at berchidda 

land use intensity had a significant impact on the diversity and
composition of bacterial and fungal communities in each location 
this shows that even though the soil s ability to host microbial di 
versity may be highly constrained by pedoclimatic properties land
use may serve as a proximal “control lever” to modify microbial
diversity this is in agreement with other studies conducted at the
field scale acosta martínez et al lienhard et al or
regional scale drenovsky et al however our study of three
contrasting locations representing different gradients of land use
intensity made it possible to link land use intensity with microbial
diversity in contrasting pedoclimatic contexts interestingly no
simple decrease in soil microbial diversity i e richness and d 
with increasing land use intensity was observed whatever the
location instead the general trend observed for both bacterial and
fungal communities in all three locations was an increase in di 
versity i e richness and d under medium land use intensity as
compared to low and high intensities in agreement with other
recent works acosta martínez et al jangid et al 
shange et al this finding suggests that the hump back
model describing the response of a community to stress giller
et al may also be applied to the microbial response to per 
turbations associatedwith landmanagement intensity according to
this model a decrease in apparent diversity may occur i in highly
stressed environment due to dominance of particularly competitive
species through competitive exclusion and ii in highly unstressed
environment due to the dominance of particularly adapted species
through selection contrastingly moderate stress may increase
apparent diversity by lowering the likehood of competitive exclu 
sion and the selection mechanism in our study this suggests that
increasing land management intensity in agrosystems may not
necessarily have a negative linear impact on soilmicrobial diversity 
but may instead enable an optimum i e climax of soil microbial
genetic resources to be attained interestingly this optimum was
reached for both bacteria and fungi at medium intensity land use at
berchidda and veluwe in the yorkshire dales however the same
pattern was observed for fungi but not for bacteria bacterial di 
versity showed a linear increase with increasing land use intensity 
this discrepancy may be ascribed to the fact that at this location
tillage was only applied in the high intensity plots soil mechanical
disturbance particularly tillage has recently been demonstrated to
increase bacterial diversity and reduce fungal diversity lienhard
et al pastorelli et al probably due to the greater
sensitivity of the fungal hyphal network to physical disruption
 helgason et al van der wal et al 

similar to the biotic and abiotic soil parameters patterns of c 
mineralization activity differed between the locations but also
along the gradient of intensification within each location fig 
partitioning of the functional variation using the set of biotic and
abiotic soils parameters revealed that e of the variance in
intensity of c cycling activities could be explained table among
the parameters selected in our model a significant proportion of
this variance was explained by soil organic matter status i e soc 
soil c n this positive effect of soil organic matter quantity and
quality on the intensity of co fluxes is well established henriksen
and breland nicolardot et al indeed the degrad 
ability and the amount of c resources are known to be two key
factors controlling soil microbial biomass and activity supported
by our results showing a correlation between molecular biomass
and soc supplementary fig as such these are the parameters
included in most of the current models of c dynamics in soil fang
et al however our results also showed that microbial di 
versity parameters were the best predictors of all the activities
measured except priming effect this finding highlights the



v tardy et al soil biology biochemistry e 
significant role of microbial diversity in determining c dynamics in
soil which may be at least as important as microbial biomass and
soil chemical and physical properties these results also confirm the
positive relationship between microbial diversity and carbon
mineralization observed in the context of other studies involving
experimental erosion of microbial diversity bell et al 
baumann et al tardy et al 

focusing on the effect of each biological variable microbial
richness was the best predictor of all the activities measured 
except pe interestingly the relative importance of bacterial vs 
fungal diversity varied between the activities measured suggesting
that the relative involvement of these two microbial groups is
dependent on the quality of the c sources de boer et al 
bacterial and to a lesser extent fungal richness were good pre 
dictors of soil basal respiration explaining and of the
variance respectively however the relationship between micro 
bial diversity and basal respiration was positive for bacteria and
negative for fungi suggesting a major role of bacteria this result
may be related to our particular soil selection which essentially
included agricultural and grassland soils in forest soils it is likely
that involvement of fungal communities in soil processes would
have been increased vo�rí�skov�a and baldrian indeed soil
fungal biomass has been demonstrated to be more affected by soil
management practices and grassland intensification than bacterial
biomass bardgett and leemans bardgett and mcalister 
 frey et al de vries et al b hence reducing the
relative involvement of fungi in ecosystem processes under inten 
sively managed agricultural land van der wal et al this
major involvement of bacteria was also observed for total miner 
alization measured after wheat residue incorporation with bac 
terial richness alone explaining of the variance of this activity
whereas the fungal diversity parameters were not significant
explanatory variables in contrast fungal richness but not bacterial
diversity explained an impressive proportion of the intensity of
wheat mineralization this is in agreement with the general
assumption that fungi are the primary decomposers of dead plant
biomass in terrestrial ecosystems vo�rí�skov�a and baldrian in
other respects the strength of the relationship between fungal
richness and residue decomposition was likely to be further
enhanced by the high recalcitrance to decomposition of the wheat
straw residues used c n ratio of fungi through their ability
to produce a wide range of extracellular enzymes and to perforate
plant cell walls are assumed to be better decomposers of recalci 
trant organic matter than bacteria de boer et al 

addition of wheat straw residues to the soil induced a pe in all
locations whatever the land use intensity highlighting the wide 
spread occurrence of this process in soil pe was the only one of the
four c activities for which the variance was more explained by soil
physical properties soil fine sand content and c n ratio together
accounting for of the variance than by the microbial di 
versity parameters taken into account in our variance partitioning
model this was not in agreement with recent studies showing that
pe may depend on interactions between different guilds of bacteria
 pascault et al and fungi fontaine et al and conse 
quently on microbial diversity however this discrepancy may be
due to the fact that these particular processes may depend more on
the composition i e presence of particular microbial populations 
groups referred to as r and k strategists pascault et al 
than on the quantitative estimates of diversity taken into account in
our model 

 conclusions

in conclusion by using three gradients of land management
intensity in three different european countries we were able to
demonstrate that increasing land management intensity in agro 
systems may not necessarily have a negative linear impact on soil
microbial diversity but may instead enable an optimum i e climax
of soil microbial genetic resources to be attained this result has
important implications since it suggests that it may be possible to
improve soil genetic resources by applying appropriate land man 
agement practices another important output of this study is that 
for the first time it has been possible to rank the soil chemical 
physical and microbiological diversity properties contributing to c 
transformations in soil thus our results indicate that microbial
diversity may be at least as good a predictor of the transformations
involved in the c cycling in soil as soil chemistry or structure 
explaining up to of the variance in intensity of the activities
measured altogether this study provides evidence in different
farming systems across europe that changes in soil microbial di 
versity in response to land use practices link to soil functioning
through modulations of carbon mineralization in soil
