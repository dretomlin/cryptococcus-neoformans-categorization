clipping removal of aboveground plant biomass is an important issue in grassland
ecology however few studies have focused on the effect of clipping on belowground
microbial communities using integrated metagenomic technologies we examined the
taxonomic and functional responses of soil microbial communities to annual clipping
 – in a grassland ecosystem of the great plains of north america our results
indicated that clipping significantly p increased root and microbial respiration
rates annual temporal variation within the microbial communities was much greater
than the significant changes introduced by clipping but cumulative effects of clipping
were still observed in the long term scale the abundances of some bacterial and
fungal lineages including actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were significantly p 
changed by clipping clipping significantly p increased the abundances of
labile carbon c degrading genes more importantly the abundances of recalcitrant
c degrading genes were consistently and significantly p increased by clipping
in the last years which could accelerate recalcitrant c degradation and weaken long 
term soil carbon stability furthermore genes involved in nutrient cycling processes
including nitrogen cycling and phosphorus utilization were also significantly increased
by clipping the shifts of microbial communities were significantly correlated with soil
respiration and plant productivity intriguingly clipping effects on microbial function may
be highly regulated by precipitation at the interannual scale altogether our results
illustrated the potential of soil microbial communities for increased soil organic matter
decomposition under clipping land use practices

guo et al clipping alters soil microbial structures

introduction

the grassland ecosystem is an important terrestrial c pool
containing almost of earth’s organic matter schlesinger 
 more than of which is stored belowground in the
form of roots and soil organic matter som shahzad et al 
 thus grasslands are potential c sinks in the context of
increasing global atmospheric co concentration provided that
they are properly managed lal et al li et al plant
tissue removal via grazing mowing and clipping plant matter 
is a central issue in land use practices and has been reported
to change plant litter decomposition semmartin et al 
klumpp et al biodiversity of plants ward et al wu
et al and nutrient cycling garibaldi et al de faccio
carvalho et al reduced plant coverage can also change the
litter layer on the soil surface increase soil energy absorbed and
emitted and amplify the diurnal soil temperature range wan
et al in addition clipping can increase evaporation from
soil and decrease transpiration of vegetation resulting in an
unpredictable net effect on soil moisture zhang et al 

as microbial communities play important roles in biogeo 
chemical cycles of c nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur
 s a mechanistic understanding of annual clipping effects
on microbial community structure and function is crucial for
a robust prediction of soil c stocks and fluxes under the
context of land use practices zhang et al belay tedla
et al however until now how microbial structure and
function respond to clipping is poorly understood and remains
controversial in many cases for example some previous studies
reported that plant tissue removal can significantly reshape
microbial community structure and function by increasing
the ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic taxa fierer et al 
 carey et al which was mainly associated with
decreased plant photosynthesis reducing c supply to roots and
belowground microbial communities craine et al bahn
et al ingram et al however another study reported
that little variations in microbial composition and diversity
were observed under clipping treatment although removal of
aboveground plant biomass can increase soil temperature while
decreasing c and nutrient pools in an experimental semi arid
grassland carey et al also it is uncertain how plant tissue
removal affects n mineralization processes and consequently
alters n availability for decomposition processes cheng et al 
 in addition interacting environmental variations such
as climate castro et al soil physical and chemical
properties bell et al vegetation mitchell et al and
substrate quantity and quality hernández and hobbie can
significantly affect soil microbial communities which convolute
the direct impacts of plant tissue removal therefore long term
monitoring of taxonomic and functional shifts of soil microbial
communities in response to annual clipping is necessary for
a comprehensive understanding of the effects of plant tissue
removal on soil microbial communities 

the advances and applications of metagenomic technologies
such as next generation sequencing and functional gene arrays
 e g geochip have revolutionized our analysis of soil microbial
communities caporaso et al shokralla et al 

tu et al yue et al xue et al b high 
throughput amplicon sequencing has been successfully used
to analyze the diversity of soil microbial communities in
forests nacke et al brown et al cong et al 
 grasslands sheik et al farmland su et al 
 and permafrost penton et al deng et al 
 meanwhile the functional gene structure and functional
potentials of soil microbial communities have been rapidly
analyzed using functional gene arrays which are still quicker
and less consumable for now than metagenomic shotgun
sequencing especially for complex microbial communities liang
et al yue et al therefore the complementarity
in terms of experimental data and analysis between high 
throughput sequencing and functional gene arrays allows us
to comprehensively estimate the composition and functional
structure of soil microbial communities 

in this study we examined taxonomic and functional
responses of grassland microbial communities to annual clipping
in a native tall grass prairie ecosystem of the us great plains
in central oklahoma latitude ◦ ′ n longitude ◦ ′ w 
this multifactor climate change experiment was established in
 with warming ◦c half precipitation − double
precipitation clipping annual biomass removal and
their combined treatments xu et al in this study we
primarily focus on the clipping treatment and soil surface
samples were collected in the clipped and control plots from
 to to test three central hypotheses first taxonomic
and functional structures of soil microbial communities would
be progressively altered as the cumulative clipping effect may
reduce nutrient e g c n p inputs from litter and change
soil properties e g temperature moisture in the long term
 years scale hamilton and frank bahn et al 
xue et al a also different taxonomic and functional
groups would show different sensitivities to clipping in the
interannual scale due to the regulation of some temporal
background variations e g precipitation on clipping effects 
lastly clipping would significantly affect soil c and nutrient
cycles by stimulating genes involved in c and n fixation
and labile recalcitrant c degradation in this study microbial
communities were analyzed using geochip as well as
sequencing of bacterial archaeal s rrna gene and fungal its
amplicons with illumina miseq technology this study provides
novel insights into the taxonomic and functional responses of
soil microbial communities to annual clipping and implies the
potential for increased som decomposition under clipping land

clipping were consistent in direction of the first dca axis in 
 and unexpectedly the shift in microbial community
function under clipping in was abnormally bigger than those
in the other years and opposite in directionality possibly due to
the strong perturbance of the other environmental factors or the
infestation of unidentified fungi 

linking microbial communities to
environmental variables
canonical correspondence analysis and mantel test were
performed to discern the linkage between soil microbial
phylogenetic and functional structures and environmental
factors figure and supplementary figures s s the
cca results indicated that microbial functional structure was
significantly f p shaped by several soil 
plant and climate variables as well as time figure a 
among these factors time precipitation temperature and c 
biomass exhibited more significant p correlations
with the variations of microbial functional structure these
soil plant climate variables and time exhibited significant
correlations with taxonomic structure of bacterial community
 f p but not fungal community f 
p based on the cca results supplementary
figures s a s a furthermore several key plant and soil
variables also exhibited strong correlations with both functional
and taxonomic community structures by mantel tests table 
for example c biomass and total biomass showed significant
 p correlation with bacterial fungal and functional
community structures and soil temperature showed significant
 p correlation with bacterial and functional community
structures importantly hr exhibited significant correlations
with bacterial community p fungal community
 p and microbial functional structure p 
as revealed by mantel tests table these results indicated
that the shifts of microbial communities were significantly
 p correlated with clipping induced changes of
soil microclimate soil respiration and aboveground plant
productivity 

a partial cca based vpa indicated that these soil plant 
climate variables as well as time could explain more variations
based on geochip data figure b than s rrna
gene supplementary figure s b and its 
supplementary figure s b sequencing data suggesting
that functional structure of microbial communities is more
sensitive to detect clipping induced environmental changes than
taxonomic structure of microbial communities specifically 
the variations in the community functional composition and
structure were explained by soil and plant 
variables time and their interactions figure b 
soil temperature and precipitation alone could directly explain
 of the variation in community functional structure
 figure b these results indicated that temperature and
precipitation were important environmental attributes that
shape the microbial community under clipping treatment 
furthermore clipping effects on some c degrading and nitrogen
cycling genes were significantly p regulated by autumnal
cumulative precipitation as indicated that clipping induced

changes in some key genes for c degradation and n cycling
were linearly p or non linearly p increased
along precipitation including those for degrading starch 
cellulose hemicellulose and vanillin lignin denitrification and
nitrification figure clipping effects on these genes in the
driest year were substantially different from those in the
other years figure therefore the response of functional
genes to clipping in possibly represented a feedback
pattern under the extreme drought condition which was greatly
different from the long term pattern of microbial functional
changes under annual clipping 

effects of annual clipping on microbial
functional genes
to understand how annual clipping affected functional processes
of soil microbial communities geochip data were further
analyzed by focusing on c n and p cycling the normalized
signal intensities were calculated to evaluate the change of gene
abundance under clipping in each year because the shift in
microbial communities under clipping in appeared in stark
opposition to all other years and correspondingly was a year
with prolonged and wide spread drought cook et al wolf
et al average normalized signal intensities across years
with the omission of the year were evaluated to obtain the
long term trends of c n and p cycling under annual clipping
 figure 

in the first year most c degradation genes
were significantly p decreased under clipping
 supplementary figure s however clipping increased
the abundance of most c degradation genes in the second
year among these genes genes whose abundance
significantly p increased under clipping were those
involved in the degradation of relatively labile c e g starch 
hemicellulose pectin and cellulose for example glucoamylase 
involved in the degradation of starch xylanase which degrades
hemicellulose and cellobiase which breaks down cellulose 
all showed significantly p higher signal intensities
under clipping interestingly clipping also significantly
 p increased the abundance of five genes involved
in the degradation of recalcitrant c e g chitin vanillin and
lignin including those encoding chitinase and phenol oxidase
 supplementary figure s in contrast in the year with
low precipitation almost all of detected c degradation genes
decreased in the relative abundance under clipping in the
last years and very few genes associated with
labile c degradation remained significantly increased under
clipping while most of the genes involved in recalcitrant c
degradation that had originally significantly increased in 
were again significantly p increased under clipping
 supplementary figure s these results suggested that the
stimulation of clipping on the genes involved in recalcitrant c
degradation was more persistent than genes involved in labile
c degradation and implied that the degradation of recalcitrant
c might be triggered as the cumulative effect of annual clipping
on microbial communities increased over time furthermore

discussion

plant tissue removal via grazing mowing and or clipping can
significantly change ecosystem c fluxes with consequent changes
in plant litter decomposition soil microbial communities and
nutrient cycling garibaldi et al klumpp et al 
de faccio carvalho et al as soil microbial community
mediate important biogeochemical processes such as c n p 
and s cycling understanding their responses to annual clipping
is crucial for a robust prediction of soil c stocks and fluxes in
this study we analyzed the potential taxonomic and functional
responses of soil microbial communities to annual clipping 
our results showed that annual clipping markedly shifted the
functional structures of soil microbial communities and relative
abundances of some bacterial and fungal lineages over time 
which generally support our three hypotheses 

previous studies showed that clipping significantly affected
the composition and productivity of plant communities ward
et al wu et al likely decreasing nutrient and
c inputs from aboveground plants semmartin et al 
klumpp et al furthermore clipping has been shown
to increase soil temperature but decrease soil water content as
did warming wan et al under clipping an increase
of root respiration and exudation was also observed bahn
et al hamilton et al collectively these shifts
in plants and microenvironments under the cumulative effects
of clipping are expected to progressively affect the structure
and functional potential of soil microbial communities across a
time span of several years our results generally supported this
hypothesis consistent with those previous studies we found
annual clipping increased plant productivity soil co efflux
and microbial activity in most of years more importantly the
microbial functional structure was not changed in the first year
but altered significantly in the following years by annual
clipping table furthermore statistical analyses proved that
the changes of microbial community structure were significantly
correlated with soil respiration soil physical and chemical
variables and above ground plant productivity besides the
relative abundance of some key bacterial and fungal phyla such
as actinobacteria bacteroidetes zygomycota and ascomycota
were significantly altered across years by annual clipping 
these results demonstrated that the shifts of soil microbial
communities under a long term clipping can cumulatively
affect certain soil ecosystem functions however certain studies
suggested clipping or mowing reduced soil co efflux microbial
biomass and activity due to decreased canopy photosynthesis
and lessened c supply from aboveground plant parts to roots 
mycorrhizae and rhizosphere microorganisms zhang et al 
 bahn et al shahzad et al the disparity
among studies may be caused by the different ecosystems studied
and or experimental designs including clipping and sampling
time 

microbial responses to global changes such as warming 
precipitation and clipping may be greatly regulated by temporal
background variations previous studies at the jasper ridge
global change experiment jrgce showed that annual
background variation of soil microbial communities was greater
than even very significant treatment effects including warming 
elevated co water addition and n addition gutknecht et al 
 another study also reported that temporal seasonal
and interannual variation overshadows the responses of soil
microbial communities to simulated global changes including
drought and n addition matulich et al consistently 
the taxonomic composition of both bacterial and fungal
communities varied substantially from year to year in our
study no significant clipping effect was observed in the overall
bacterial and fungal communities most likely due to the large
interannual background variation in soil microbial community
overshadowing the response of bacterial and fungal communities
to clipping matulich et al correspondingly interannual
background variations affected the relative abundance of bacterial
and fungal phyla more significantly than annual clipping also 
interannual background variation was more significant than
the effect of clipping on soil microbial functional genes the
abundance of many functional genes involved in c fixation c
degradation n cycling and p utilization greatly fluctuated in
different years these results suggested that microbial responses
to annual clipping were strongly shaped by temporal background
variations 

more interestingly we found a stark contrast in the
functional community response to clipping when the ecosystem
underwent an extreme drought disturbance as well as a
significant correlation between precipitation and clipping 
induced changes in some c degrading or n cycling genes 
furthermore precipitation was found to be one of the most
important factors in explaining the variations of functional
community structure in our study previous studies also reported
that altered precipitation in different years can significantly
change fungal and bacterial community structures schmidt
et al castro et al precipitation can shift microbial
biomass community composition and activity directly by
changing soil moisture as well as indirectly through shaping
plant community potentially with a lag schmidt et al 
castro et al provided these information it may be
that the effects of clipping on microbial functional activities
are strongly associated with precipitation at the interannual
scale 

in our study no significant changes of the overall taxonomic
structure of bacteria and fungi were observed in all years 
whereas microbial functional structure was significantly shifted
by clipping in the continuous four years furthermore 
the variations of soil microbial functional structure were
closely related to clipping induced environmental changes 
while the taxonomic variations were only poorly explained
by environmental condition no significant correlation was
observed between taxonomic groups and functional gene groups 
such phenomena have been previously observed in the global
ocean or in soil raes et al louca et al 
nelson et al these results can be explained by an

guo et al clipping alters soil microbial structures

elegant paradigm for microbial ecology in which community
function is strongly shaped by energetic and stoichiometric
constraints raes et al while the composition within
functional groups is modulated by additional mechanisms 
according to this paradigm the functional responses of microbial
communities to clipping can decouple with microbial taxonomic
variations 

whether the clipping stimulated microbial community
resulted in the significant changes of soil c and n cycling is
another central hypothesis some studies showed that clipping
reduced total soil co efflux composing of root respiration
and mineralization of plant litter and recalcitrant som by
 – wan and luo shahzad et al in contrast 
another study showed a tr increase under clipping treatment
 antonsen and olsson significant increases in total
and heterotrophic soil respirations by clipping were observed
in our study theoretically the increase of soil respiration
could be due to the increase of microbial biomass and or the
variation of microbial community structure marschner et al 
 bond lamberty et al however very limited
amounts of samples were available from this long term field
experiment thus we didn’t investigate microbial biomass in
this study we focused on the variation of community structure 
significant correlations between soil hr and the variations
of bacterial fungal and functional community structures
suggested that the variation of community structure significantly
modified soil c cycling regardless of potential altered microbial
biomass 

although annual background variations e g precipitation 
strongly affected functional patterns of soil microbial community
in different years progressive changes of c degradation under
clipping were still observed in our geochip data in the first year 
annual clipping as a strong disturbance to grassland ecosystem
not only decreased soil microbial community functional diversity
but also decreased most of gene abundances involved in c
degradation this may be a short term response to the decrease of
aboveground c input and the sudden changes of soil temperature
and moisture under annual clipping in the following years 
except the abundance of key genes involved in the
degradation of labile and recalcitrant c increased under annual
clipping suggesting that reduced inputs of aboveground c under
clipping did not suppress microbial activity probably because
of the offset by elevated belowground biomass through such
processes as root exudation hamilton et al and root
decay belay tedla et al there were no significant
reductions in aboveground plant biomass in the clipped plots
and in fact in the last years there were significant increases
in the clipped plots this means that the plant growth rates
were stimulated by annual clipping a likely consequence of
this is enhanced root development and increased exudation
by actively growing roots indeed significant increase of root
respiration under clipping measured as ar was observed in
this grassland ecosystem this may be the reason why soil
total c did not significantly decrease under annual clipping 
more importantly the abundances of genes involved in the
degradation of some recalcitrant substrates were consistently
increased in the last years under annual clipping indicating

that the recalcitrant c degradation may be triggered under
annual clipping since the recalcitrant carbon in soil is much
more abundant than labile carbon even a small change in
its decomposition rate could have significant effect on soil c
storage davidson and janssens by this way clipping
land use practices may significantly affect future climate warming
scenarios 

how clipping or mowing changes ecosystem n cycling is
another important issue a previous study showed that total
n contents of soil at the great plains apiaries oklahoma
were significantly decreased by clipping resulting in n deficient
soil conditions belay tedla et al and another study
showed that yearly clipping significantly decreased litter n
contents indicating a significant effect of n deficiency on plants
 cheng et al consistently a significant decrease in
no − n was observed under annual clipping in our study 
suggesting that soil n dynamics were significantly altered 
in our geochip data average signal intensities across 
years with the omission of the year indicated that
annual clipping also stimulated the abundance of most
key genes involved in n cycling including ammonification 
denitrification n assimilation and nitrogen fixation the
significant increases in the abundance of n cycling genes may
result in a potential increase of nutrient cycling process rates 
in high n cycling rates n fixation and n mineralization
through recycling n from som would compensate n loss by
denitrification as well as enhance plant growth zhou et al 
 as a result the total soil n may remain unchanged
under annual clipping however the effects of long term
clipping on soil n dynamics may depend on the balance
of the accumulation derived from the inputs from litter and
root biomass decomposition microbial n fixation and the
consumption of n mineralization denitrification and plant
uptake 

conclusion

despite the important roles of the soil microbial communities
in carbon and nitrogen cycling the responses of microbial
community structure and function under long term clipping
are not fully understood in this study the functional structure
of soil microbial community was significantly altered by 
years of clipping and the relative abundance of bacterial and
fungal lineages was also significantly changed under annual
clipping furthermore annual clipping significantly increased
the abundance of genes involved in the degradation of labile
and recalcitrant c nitrogen cycling and phosphorus utilization
in the long term scale the shifts in microbial community
structure and function were significantly correlated with soil
microclimate c and nutrient concentrations respiration and
plant productivity interestingly the effects of clipping on
microbial functional activities may be heavily associated with
precipitation at the interannual scale annual clipping induced
changes in microbial community structure and function may
be important in predicting long term land use responses to
global change
